# Session Initialisation

**Mission**: Build YOUR internal context so you can help the user effectively. You are preparing yourself, not reporting to the user.

**Constraint**: READ-ONLY. No commits, no issues, no branches, no pushes.

---

## Steps

**Bash rule for every step below**: run each command as a **separate** bash tool call. Do NOT chain with `&&` / `||` / `;` / `|` / `>` / `` ` `` / `$(…)` — `permission-guard` refuses any command containing those characters (anti-injection invariant) and the combined form falls through to deny. Do NOT prefix with `cd <path>` either — Pi's bash tool already runs in the project cwd.

1. **Branch check** — run each as its own bash call:
   - `git status`
   - `git branch --show-current`
   - `git worktree list`

   If uncommitted changes exist: decide if they belong to current task. Stash or worktree-park if not.

2. **Index the codebase** (if not already indexed): `mcp({tool: "codebase_memory_index_repository", args: '{"repo_path": "."}'})`. Idempotent — safe to call every /start; the server skips re-indexing if the working tree hasn't changed.

   **Note**: For structural queries during /start (architecture overview, key entry points), use `codebase_memory_get_architecture({path: "."})` instead of running `search_code` for meta-questions.

3. **Context sweep** — dispatch explore specialist. **Do NOT wait for it before starting step 4** — explore and your own bash reads run concurrently.
   - Use the `dispatch_specialist` tool with `role: explore` and prompt:
     "Run the /start synthesis sweep following your `/start synthesis sweep` section. Return only the synthesis tier: the maturity one-line judgment, the gotchas not yet in AGENTS.md, and an architecture/cross-file-dependency note only where genuinely useful. Everything else you would otherwise report — project identity, conventions, quality gates, open work, CI health — I already hold from my own step-4/step-5 reads and from AGENTS.md, which is already in my context. No raw output."

4. **Current state of work** — run these directly IN THE SAME PM TURN as step 3's dispatch (one bash call each, all in parallel):
   - `oo git log --oneline -10`
   - `oo git shortlog -sn --no-merges`
   - `oo git for-each-ref --sort=-committerdate refs/heads --format='%(HEAD) %(refname:short) %(committerdate:relative)'`
   - `git log -1 --format=%cd -- AGENTS.md`
   - Forge state — pick by the detected forge (`git remote get-url origin` host: `github.com` → GitHub, `gitlab.com` → GitLab, otherwise skip these and note "forge undetected"), one bash call each:
     - GitHub: `gh issue list --limit 15`, `gh pr list`, `gh run list --branch main --limit 3`
     - GitLab: `glab issue list --limit 15`, `glab mr list`, `glab ci list --limit 3`

   These are read-only — no dispatch, no subagent spawn, no GLM summarisation dependency. The output is yours to synthesise in step 6.

   **AGENTS.md staleness check** (reuses the output already read above — no new command). If the AGENTS.md read came back empty (the file is missing), or its commit date is older than the 10th-most-recent commit from the `oo git log --oneline -10` output above, note it in the readiness line and point the operator at the sibling `/agents-md` command to regenerate — check-and-pointer only, never run a regenerate yourself.

5. **What `/work` left behind** — run these directly, one call each, alongside step 4. Use the `read` tool for the directory listing — **NOT a bash `ls`**: `ls` is not on the PM's bash allowlist and a refused call is a data gap that must be reported, not narrated around.
   - `read` tool on `.pi/work-state/` (directory listing — the read tool handles directories; `ls` is not allowlisted for the PM)
   - `cat .pi/work-state/queue-summary.json`

   This is the most actionable state in the repo and the only part of it that is invisible everywhere else. A parked cycle has no open PR and no issue comment; a group that never started has no state file at all — `queue-summary.json` is the only record it existed.

   Both reads fail harmlessly in a repo that has never run `/work` (a missing directory is an empty result, not an error). **Absence is silent** — say nothing rather than reporting a missing file as a finding. A *refused or failed* read, by contrast, is a data gap, not an absence — handle it per the rule in the Output section below.

   From the summary, carry into step 6: each parked group's issue numbers and its `humanAction`, the groups under `notStarted`, and how long ago `at` was. A summary from last week is history, not this morning's queue — say which.

6. **End your turn after step 4's and step 5's reads — do NOT wait or poll.** The explore dispatch's `[ensemble:async]` report auto-delivers when it completes and resumes you; **then** synthesise step 4's raw output + step 5's driver state + explore's synthesis tier into the one readiness line. Never spin on `dispatch_status`. If the report is incomplete or missing its synthesis tier (the maturity judgment, or the not-in-AGENTS.md gotchas), re-dispatch explore once (Reconnaissance Doctrine resilience fallback) and end your turn again.

7. **Store findings**: `vipune add '<project identity, current state, conventions, gotchas>'` (single bash call; quoted argument).

## Output

One readiness line:
- Project (with maturity + team size from telemetry)
- Current status (active work, CI health, hotspots)
- **Anything `/work` parked, named with its action** — "#287 parked, needs acceptance criteria; group g4 (#301, #302) never started". This goes before the general status: it is the only part the operator cannot find any other way, and it is usually why they opened the session.
- "Ready for instructions."

**Report data gaps, don't narrate them away.** If any readiness data source fails or is refused (the `.pi/work-state/` reads, `gh issue list`, `gh pr list`, the CI check), say so explicitly in the line — e.g. "parked-work status: unavailable (check refused)". Never present a partial readiness summary as complete, and never invent a benign explanation for a failed or refused call — report the failure and continue with the sources that worked.

This is NOT a report — you are confirming readiness.

## Principles

- **Parallel first** — explore dispatch (step 3) and direct reads (steps 4 and 5) run concurrently in the same PM turn.
- **End the turn, don't wait** — a dispatch's `[ensemble:async]` report resumes you; the only legitimate `dispatch_status` call is the single pre-`dispatch_kill` check.
- Build on existing knowledge, don't repeat what's in memory.
- Discover, don't assume.
- Focus on what enables productivity.
