description: Idempotently create / update / check the heading-managed sections of this repo's AGENTS.md via the agents_md_run tool. The tool runs a pure TypeScript renderer in-process; the file surgery is deterministic and byte-preserving for anything outside the managed heading-delimited sections.

# /agents-md: idempotent AGENTS.md management

**Verb**: first argument of `$ARGUMENTS` (default `update`). `--deep` turns
on real execution of the gate commands during `check` only.

This command is executed by the **`agents_md_run` tool**, which runs the
compiled TypeScript core (`extension/src/agents-md/`) in-process. The core is
a pure-function renderer whose idempotency is *proven by a test* (double-render
`Buffer.equals`), and whose splice touches **only** the bytes inside its own
managed heading-delimited sections. Your job as the PM here is to call the
tool, interpret its structured result, show the operator the diff it renders,
and ask — not to edit the file yourself.

You MUST NOT hand-edit `AGENTS.md` for this command. Every byte change goes
through the tool. This is the difference between a tool whose correctness is a
theorem and a tool whose correctness is a hope.

---

## The state machine

Before doing anything, classify the target file (`<repoRoot>/AGENTS.md`). The
`create`/`update` results carry `plan.state` (`no-file` / `no-managed-headings`
/ `has-managed-headings`) — use that when you already have a result, otherwise
classify yourself:

| State | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `no-file` | no `AGENTS.md` | `create` is automatic (reads + a create-when-absent write); show the diff, write |
| `no-managed-headings` | file exists but has no pi-rukas managed section headings | **brownfield wrap** (see below) — WRAPPING ONLY |
| `has-managed-headings` | managed heading-delimited sections present | `update` (no-op when current) |
| `sections-stale` | managed sections present but drift detected | `update` to re-derive; show diff, ask |
| `ambiguous-corruption` | a managed heading appears twice in the file (duplicate section) | **STOP.** Report the duplication verbatim. Never guess a repair.

Then overlay the **git-dirty** state: if `git status --porcelain -- AGENTS.md`
is non-empty, say so up front. The core never auto-resolves a dirty file — it
splices from the bytes on disk, so a dirty working tree means the diff is
against an uncommitted baseline. Surface that; let the operator decide.

## Pre-pass: dispatch an explore child for agent-derived facts

Before calling `agents_md_run` with `create` or `update`, **first check the
trigger condition** and, if it fires, dispatch a read-only explore-role child
to produce `AgentFacts`.

### Trigger condition

Dispatch the pre-pass **when any of these**:
1. The repo has **no recognised manifest** (`package.json`, `Cargo.toml`,
   `go.mod`, or `pyproject.toml` at the root) — i.e. `detectFacts(root)`
   would return `manifest: undefined` (Ruby/Gemfile, true greenfield,
   unrecognised ecosystems), **OR**
2. The current `AGENTS.md` has **no `code-style` managed section** (no
   heading-delimited `code-style` section in the file), **OR**
3. The current `AGENTS.md` has **no `architecture-notes` managed section**
   (no heading-delimited `architecture-notes` section in the file).

In words: dispatch when the manifest is undefined **OR any agent-derived
section** (`code-style`, `architecture-notes`) **is absent**.

**Skip the dispatch entirely** only when ALL conditions are false: the
manifest is recognised AND both the code-style and the architecture-notes
sections already exist.

**Bounded fallback (docless repo with filed issues)**: when the repo has
**open GitHub issues** but **no manifest** AND **no planning docs** (no
`docs/` directory with planning/architecture content) AND **no populated
architecture-notes section**, you may skip the explore dispatch entirely and
run the bounded read-only query yourself:

```
gh issue list --state open --limit 20 --json number,title,body
```

Read the **titles in full**; treat **bodies as truncated** to a reasonable
character budget per issue (titles are the dense signal; a body is there to
extract decisions from, not to quote at length). From the issues, extract
**dense, specific decision bullets** in the same shape as the pre-pass's
`architectureBullets` (module→responsibility, critical-path rules, stated
intent/tech-stack choices — one concrete claim per bullet, no prose) and pass
them **directly** into `agentOverride.architectureBullets` on the
`agents_md_run` call. This path needs **no child dispatch**: the PM already
ran the query itself. The gate (open issues exist AND no manifest AND no
planning docs AND no populated architecture-notes) exists to avoid
double-ingestion when docs or a manifest already provide the signal. A
failing, empty, or unauthenticated `gh` call (no issues, no `gh`, no auth)
degrades gracefully to the normal pre-pass path — it never blocks or aborts
the /agents-md flow.

### The dispatch

Use `dispatch_specialist` with `role: "explore"` (structurally denied
write/edit via role-tools). The prompt should demand **dense, specific**
facts — exact shell lines, not narrative, plus the project's ACTUAL testing
setup. Reference the [randomm/oo AGENTS.md](https://github.com/randomm/oo/blob/main/AGENTS.md) quality bar: exact command lines, no
filler.

The dispatch prompt must include:

> You have the `report_facts` tool. Read the repository's source files,
> build system, CI workflows, and any existing style documentation to derive
> the project's facts. Call `report_facts` EXACTLY ONCE with the facts you
> found. Rules:
> - `commands`: exact shell lines (the command that goes into AGENTS.md),
>   each with `kind` (test|lint|format|typecheck|build) and a `name` label.
> - `ciWorkflows`: RAW FILENAMES ONLY (e.g. "ci.yml") — do NOT include the
>   `.github/workflows/` prefix; the renderer applies it.
> - `codeStyleBullets`: dense, specific bullets (exact rules, no prose).
>   Each bullet is one concrete rule, not a paragraph.
> - `testingNotes`: dense, specific bullets about the ACTUAL testing setup
>   you observed (test runner + coverage floor, in-module vs integration
>   test placement, a test-count floor, a skip/`#[ignore]` convention).
>   Exact values, no prose, no invention — only what you verified in the
>   repo (CI config, test runner config files, test directory structure).
>   Omit the field if none were observed — the Testing Standards section
>   then renders its static doctrine only.
> - `architectureBullets`: dense, specific bullets mapping key source
>   files/directories to their roles plus critical-path rules (e.g.
>   "src/classify.rs is the critical path — changes require corresponding
>   tests"). One module→responsibility or rule per bullet, no prose
>   paragraphs, and NO tables — bullets only. Omit the field entirely if
>   the repo has no meaningful module structure (e.g. a single-file
>   script); never fill it with generic filler.
> - `language`, `packageManager`, `manifest`: only if you can confirm them
>   from files in the repo. Do not guess.

**Companion extension load (FACTS_EXTRA_ARGS)**: the dispatch must pass
`--no-skills --extension <facts-reporter-path>` as extra args to the child,
where `<facts-reporter-path>` is the path to `extension/src/facts-reporter.ts`
(relative to the Pi extension install dir). This follows the exact pattern of
`PLAN_EXTRA_ARGS` in `plan-investigate.ts`. The child sees both its role
prompt AND the `report_facts` tool.

### Scoping rule (rich-manifest repos)

When the repo **has** a recognised manifest (`detectFacts(root).manifest`
≠ `undefined`) AND the only reason the dispatch fires is that one or more
agent-derived sections are absent: the caller passes **only the missing
section's bullets** into `agentOverride` — `codeStyleBullets` when the
code-style section is absent, `architectureBullets` when the
architecture-notes section is absent (both, when both are absent). The child's
`commands`/`manifest`/`language`/`packageManager` fields are **ignored** for
the fact sections — this prevents a routine agent-section-only dispatch from
silently converting a rich project's `[auto,...]` provenance rows to
`[detected:agent,...]`.

### Refresh framing

When the operator triggers a refresh (e.g. `/agents-md update --refresh` or
an explicit "refresh the agent-derived sections" request), re-dispatch the
**same** pre-pass with a prompt framed for refresh:

> You have the `report_facts` tool. Re-read the repository's current state
> and report updated facts via `report_facts` (exactly once call). Only the
> sections that were previously agent-derived (provenance `detected` in the
> sidecar at `.pi/agents-md-state.json`) will be re-written; sections with
> `[auto,...]` or `[asked:operator,...]` provenance are never overwritten. Report all fields you can derive; the
> provenance gate in the tool handles which ones actually land.

After conversion, call `agents_md_run` with `update`, the new
`agentOverride`, and `refresh: true`. This goes through the **same**
ask-before-write flow (dryRun first, show the real diff, operator confirms).

### Graceful failure

If the pre-pass dispatch **fails**, **times out**, or returns **no
`report_facts` tool call** (i.e. the child's `toolUses` array contains no entry
with `name === "report_facts"`), treat it exactly like
`extractPolicyAnswer`'s absent-call handling: **proceed by calling
`agents_md_run` WITHOUT an `agentOverride` parameter at all**. This falls
back entirely to B1's existing deterministic/omission behavior.

A **partial** `report_facts` call (e.g. `codeStyleBullets` present but
`commands` absent, or `architectureBullets` absent because the repo has no
meaningful module structure) applies **only the populated fields** — the
conversion function's total/lossless contract handles absent fields as
undefined/empty naturally. A partial reply is not a failure: an absent
`architectureBullets` means the section is simply not created (no marker
pair, no omission row, no filler), never force-populated.

## Call the tool

Use the **`agents_md_run` tool**:

```
agents_md_run(verb: "create" | "update" | "check",
              deep?: boolean,      // check only; rejected with a structured
                                   // error on create/update
              scaffold?: boolean,  // append 7 boilerplate sections (default ON for create)
              answers?: {           // operator interview answers (5 Qs)
                coverageThreshold?: string,
                reviewBlockingSeverity?: string,
                mergeAuthority?: string,
                projectConstraints?: string,
                projectIntent?: string,
              },
              dryRun?: boolean,     // plan is computed, no write is performed
              agentOverride?: {     // B1↔B2 seam (update only): agent-derived facts
                facts?: AgentFacts, // raw wire format (language?, packageManager?,
                                    //   manifest?, commands?, codeStyleBullets?,
                                    //   ciWorkflows?, testingNotes?, architectureBullets?)
                                    //   — converted internally; codeStyleBullets/
                                    //   architectureBullets stay on the AgentFacts side
                                    //   (never on DetectedFacts)
                codeStyleBullets?: string[],      // dense bullets for code-style section
                architectureBullets?: string[],   // module→responsibility + critical-path
                                                  // bullets for architecture-notes
              },
              refresh?: boolean)    // update only: when true + agentOverride,
                                    // directly replace [detected:agent] sections
```

The tool resolves the repo root itself; you pass no paths. The `agentOverride`
parameter (when supplied) carries the raw `AgentFacts` from the pre-pass —
the tool converts it to `DetectedFacts` internally. You pass the wire format
directly; no conversion function call is needed. The `facts.testingNotes`
field (when the pre-pass reported it) is appended as a clearly-demarcated
"Project-specific" supplement to the Testing Standards section on FIRST-TIME
scaffold population only (a create, or an update where the section is still
absent) — it is never re-rendered, refreshed, or stamped with ledger
provenance, and an absent field leaves the section byte-identical to the
static doctrine.

The result is structured — do not parse prose:

- `create`/`update` results: `exitCode` plus
  `plan: { state, newBytes, oldBytes, wouldWrite, managedIds, omitted, drift, scaffoldedIds }`
- `check` results: `exitCode` plus
  `check: { code, findings: [{kind, message}[]], corrupt }` — on the
  `no-file` case `check` is absent and `error` is present; render `error`
- a `dryRun: true` create/update returns the full plan (including `newBytes`)
  without writing anything
- `agentOverride` is only honoured on the has-managed-headings `update` path;
  it is silently ignored on create and no-managed-headings (wrap) paths

The tool also renders a human-readable summary in its `text` output: for
create/update, the CLI-style report (would-write vs no-op, managed ids,
omitted sections, drift) PLUS a unified diff of `plan.oldBytes` →
`plan.newBytes` (truncated to 200 lines); for check, one line per finding.
Read it; that IS the plan.

**The exit code is the contract**:

- `0` clean — managed sections are well-formed, nothing referenced is missing
- `1` findings / drift — the file parses, but a referenced path is gone, a
  gate command's tool is off PATH, a managed section is empty (heading
  present, zero body lines), or a ledger row drifted from its derivation
- `2` refuse / corrupt / invalid — a managed heading is duplicated or
  malformed, or a `create` on an existing file

**`exitCode` 2 → stop.** Do not continue the verb. Report the reason and, for
corruption, the exact message the result carries.

**`exitCode` 1 with no write** (e.g. a brownfield classification finding) →
run the numbered-list protocol below to resolve the decision, then call the
tool again.

---

## The auto-vs-ask rule

These are **automatic** (no question, no confirmation gate):
- every read, every `check`
- a no-op `update` (`plan.wouldWrite` is false — the write codepath is
  provably not entered)
- `create` when the file is absent

Everything else is **ask**:
- any `create`/`update` with `plan.wouldWrite: true` that would replace or
  insert bytes the operator authored — show the unified diff from the tool
  result first, then ask for explicit go-ahead before calling the tool again
  (without `dryRun`) to perform the write.
- a brownfield wrap (it inserts new managed heading-delimited sections into a
  human file).

When you are going to ask, call the tool with `dryRun: true` first — the
result carries the exact bytes that would be written, so the diff you show
is real, not projected.

The ask is a numbered list, per the protocol below. Never write foreign bytes
replaced without a shown diff and an explicit answer.

---

## Numbered-list question protocol

When a decision genuinely cannot be derived, ask in this exact shape — 2–4
options, the **default is the lowest-consequence choice**, and pressing Enter
accepts the default:

```
1. [DEFAULT] <lowest-consequence option — e.g. "omit the section and record it in the sidecar">
2. <alternative A>
3. <alternative B>
```

Rules:
- The default MUST be the option that changes the fewest bytes and the least
  state (usually "omit + ledger row", never "write a guessed value").
- Record the operator's answer **in the same transaction as the write** — the
  answer becomes an `[asked:operator,<date>]` row in the sidecar (`.pi/agents-md-state.json`)
  that the write records, so the decision and its effect land together or not at all.
- If the operator is absent (headless), see the headless clause.

---

## Greenfield interview (before tool call)

When `scaffold` is passed to a `create` (no-file) verb — or omitted, since
scaffolding is ON BY DEFAULT for create — the tool
applies the scaffold post-pass, which appends 7 boilerplate sections
(6 static + the answer-aware `testing-standards`)
and optionally an `operator-choices` section (from interview answers).
Pass `scaffold: false` to create a plain managed-only file.

Ask these 5 questions BEFORE calling the tool:

1. **Coverage threshold** — what test coverage is required? (default: the Testing Standards section renders the ≥80% opinionated default)
2. **Review-blocking severity** — which severity blocks merge? (default: omit)
3. **Merge authority** — who/what can merge PRs? (default: omit)
4. **Project-specific constraints** — any additional rules? (default: omit)
5. **Project intent & tech stack** — describe what this project is and any best-practices target in your own words (e.g. "Python project following 2026 best practices, FastAPI, async-first"). (default: omit)

Protocol:
- 2–4 options per question, default is the lowest-consequence choice
- If the operator is absent (headless), see the headless clause
- Unanswered → the Testing Standards section renders the ≥80% opinionated default (the other 4 interview questions keep the omit-on-unanswered rule)
- Answered → `operator-choices` section + `[asked:operator]` ledger rows (the coverage value itself lives ONLY in the Testing Standards section; operator-choices omits its coverage bullet). The 5th answer (project intent) lands **exclusively** in operator-choices — never in architecture-notes or any agent-derived section

---

## The headless clause (no UI)

If there is no interactive UI (headless / `pi -p` / a driver dispatch):
- **`dryRun` is always permitted** — this is a carve-out from the no-write
  rule. `dryRun: true` computes the full plan and is safe to call headless.
- **Show the advisory diff.** Run the verb with `dryRun: true` and surface
  the rendered diff. For scaffolded creates, the Testing Standards section
  renders its ≥80% opinionated default coverage line; the other 4 interview
  questions remain unanswered (no operator-choices section is written).
- **Write nothing.** A headless run must not auto-adopt a human file or
  write any assumed-answer ledger rows. The `operator-choices` section and
  `[asked:operator]` rows are NEVER written headless — this applies to the
  5th question (project intent) exactly as it does to the other 3:
  headless, no assumed answer, no bullet, no ledger row.
- **Re-ask next interactive run.** Report that the run is gated on a human.
  The next interactive session will re-ask the 5 interview questions and
  produce the real write.

Never auto-adopt a brownfield file headless.

---

## Brownfield adoption = WRAPPING ONLY, plus scaffold-append when scaffold is set

For a file that exists but has no managed section headings, the ONLY
permitted change is to **wrap** (doctrine-untouched) **plus scaffold-append
when scaffold is set**:

**Wrap** (always permitted): the tool parses the existing `## ` sections,
classifies each as `machine` (facts the core can re-derive: commands,
environment) / `doctrine` (human rules, taste, machine-read sentences like
merge authority) / `add` (a managed section that is absent), and produces a
per-section plan. The default plan is **doctrine-untouched**: every existing
section is left exactly where it is, with its heading and bytes intact; the
core appends only the heading-delimited managed sections it can derive.

**Scaffold-append** (when `scaffold: true`): after the wrap, 7 boilerplate
sections are appended. These are universal text — language
specifics come from the managed fact sections. The refusal condition becomes
`machineByLine.size === 0 && appended.length === 0 && scaffoldBodies.length === 0`
so a repo with no machine sections can still wrap if scaffold boilerplate
will be appended.

Assert, before the write: the diff in the tool result is
**insertions-only** (appended managed heading-delimited sections). No line
of the original file is deleted or reworded. If the plan would delete or
rename anything — or the result reports a classification ambiguity — it is not
a wrap you may take; stop and ask (the ambiguity result exits `1` with one
finding per ambiguous section; a reword/delete or nothing-classifiable result
exits `2`).

---

## Refusals (never, under any verb)

- ❌ Never edit bytes **outside** the managed heading-delimited sections. The
  splice keeps everything else verbatim; a diff that shows changes there is a
  bug, not a result.
- ❌ Never rename a human heading.
- ❌ Never delete a human section or line.
- ❌ Never `git commit` or push — that is @ops, and this command leaves the
  file uncommitted by design.
- ❌ No side-effectful execution during `check` (the default checks are
  existence-level only: paths exist, `command -v`, `bash -n`). `deep: true`
  runs the commands (subprocess execution, up to 60s each — potentially
  long-running), but only on explicit opt-in, and only for `check`.
- ❌ No LLM fallback for content. A section the core cannot derive is **omitted**
  and recorded as an `[auto] section omitted: <reason>` row in the sidecar
  (`.pi/agents-md-state.json`) — never invented.
- ❌ Never operate on a file whose managed sections are duplicated or
  malformed. A malformed structure is a stop, not a guess.
- ❌ Never auto-adopt a brownfield file headless.
- ❌ Never fall back to shelling out to the core (e.g. `bun
  extension/src/agents-md/agents-md.ts …`) — that path does not exist on host
  repos. The tool is the only execution path for this command.

---

## Report back

Your final message must state: the verb, the exit code, the managed section
ids, any omitted sections and why, any drift, and — when a write happened —
the exact diff you showed and the operator's answer. If you stopped (exit 2
or a headless ask-case), state the exact reason and the verbatim error or
finding the tool result carried.
