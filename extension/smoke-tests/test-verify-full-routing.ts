/**
 * A failing full verification must not reach `merged`.
 *
 * `runCi` runs a second, stricter verification before it watches CI —
 * `.pi/verify-cmd-full`, which in this repo runs `tsc --noEmit`, `bun run check`
 * and the vipune fixture suites with `PI_ENSEMBLE_VIPUNE_REQUIRED=1`, i.e.
 * strictly more than CI does. On failure (`work-driver-stepback-ci.ts:202-229`)
 * it appends `verify-full-status: failure`, bumps `ciRetryCount`, and returns —
 * emitting **no** `ci-status` and no cap-hit until the retry cap is blown.
 *
 * `nextStep` had no branch for `verify-full-status`, so the tail fell through to
 * the linear table, where `ci: "merged"`. The step's own comment says "the
 * ci-retry cap will fire on the next iteration"; there is no next iteration,
 * because the cycle has already left `ci`.
 *
 * Measured before the fix:
 *
 *     tail=verify-full-status:failure  ->  merged
 *     tail=ci-status:failure           ->  develop
 *
 * `verifyFullEnabled()` is opt-OUT and this repo ships `.pi/verify-cmd-full`, so
 * this was live on every pi-ensemble cycle.
