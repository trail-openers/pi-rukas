/**
 * An inactivity kill must be diagnosable, not merely tuned.
 *
 * The watchdog SIGTERMs a child after 25 minutes of total silence, and the
 * kill was recorded as a bare cause: `inactivity`, plus the budget. That
 * cannot distinguish two entirely different failures:
 *
 *   - a child that went quiet **after forty tool calls** — a genuine hang,
 *     mid-work, with real output on disk to recover;
 *   - a child that **never said anything at all** — a provider stall, an auth
 *     failure, a bad model id — where there is nothing to recover and the
 *     issue is upstream of the agent entirely.
 *
 * They need opposite responses, and a wall-clock number can tell them apart in
 * neither direction. The standing temptation is to raise the budget; that is
 * precisely the mistake the six per-role timers were deleted for, since each
 * was raised twice and each time the finding was that the number was too small
 * for a HEALTHY child.
 *
 * So this records the SHAPE of the silence — what the child last emitted, how
 * long before the kill, and how many lines it had produced in total.
 * `linesSeen: 0` is the tell.
