/**
 * A tool PM cannot call without a prompt is a tool PM does not have.
 *
 * `agents.json` sets `"*": "ask"` for project-manager and then allowlists every
 * dispatch tool by name. Registering a new tool therefore does NOT make it
 * usable: it falls through to `ask`, so every call interrupts the user — and in
 * headless `pi -p`, novel calls are hard-denied outright.
 *
 * That is exactly what happened to `start_work_driver` and
 * `load_workflow_doctrine`. They were registered, described, named in the
 * sticky preamble, and documented in AGENTS.md and the README — and PM would
 * still have been stopped at the permission layer on first use. The tools were
 * built to end an incident where PM hand-rolled the driver because it had
 * nothing to call; shipping them behind a prompt would have half-reproduced it.
 *
 * So the rule is mechanical: every tool this extension registers is resolved in
 * PM's permission map, or listed below with the reason it is not.
