/**
 * #398 — what the handoff actually says to the operator. **No test anywhere
 * asserted on rendered handoff content**, which is why this shipped:
 * `intent-park` inherited a `developer-timeout` recovery block and told the
 * operator (live, #337) to retry a timeout that never happened and run
 * `git push -u origin (branch not captured)` — a placeholder in a command.
 *
 * The `&&` assertions are not cosmetic: these lines land in the Pi chat, and
 * the permission matcher cannot wildcard a chained shape, so every unique
 * chain re-prompts the operator.
