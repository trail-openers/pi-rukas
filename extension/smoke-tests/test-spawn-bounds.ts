/**
 * A child's life is bounded by liveness, and the cap bounds pids — not tokens.
 *
 * Two defects, one theme: both invented a number to stand in for information
 * we did not have.
 *
 * 1. **Six per-role wall-clock caps.** They were raised twice — #296 (lens and
 *    ops sat below a single xhigh-thinking turn) and #553 (a developer was 43
 *    min into substantive work when the 30-min cap SIGTERM'd it) — and both
 *    times the finding was identical: the number was too small for a HEALTHY
 *    child. Provider speed varies by an order of magnitude, so no wall-clock
 *    number means the same thing on two models. The table had already drifted
 *    out of sync with its own documentation (troubleshooting.md claimed 15 min
 *    for lenses the code set to 45). Replaced by ONE runaway backstop, with
 *    `inactivityTimeoutMs` — silence, not slowness — as the real detector.
 *
 * 2. **A global spawn cap of 12.** Its own docstring conceded that "a single
 *    M=6 develop step needs 6 (or 12 with speculative explores)" — so one
 *    cycle consumed the entire global cap and a second concurrent cycle got
 *    ZERO slots, queueing FIFO behind it. That queueing was measured across 69
 *    terminal cycles as "roles run ~2.4x slower under concurrency" and read as
 *    provider contention. It was this semaphore. Provider capacity is rationed
 *    by the provider (429 + `retry-after`, which `retry-config-check` verifies
 *    the host honours); this cap only ever bounded local pids.
 *
 * The compensation is gone too: `develop` used to switch speculative explore
 * OFF whenever groups ran concurrently, to fit under a cap we chose. The
 * explore is now opt-in for an unrelated reason — measured live, the developer
 * never once read the scratch file it writes — so the cap is sized for the
 * 2-per-workstream ceiling the knob can still reach, not for the default.
