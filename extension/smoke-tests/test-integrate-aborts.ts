/**
 * Four ways ONE developer aborted the whole integration, against real git.
 *
 * Every one was reproduced on a fixture before being fixed, and every one is a
 * single-developer defect that becomes near-certain as workstream count grows
 * — which is why they had to land before parallelism widened. At N=10 the
 * chance that no workstream contains a binary, a rename, or an overlapping
 * hunk is small.
 *
 *   1. **Binary files.** `git diff --cached` was captured without `--binary`,
 *      so blobs became the textual placeholder `Binary files a/x and b/x
 *      differ`, which `git apply` refuses outright.
 *
 *   2. **Non-ASCII filenames.** `git status --porcelain` C-quotes them
 *      (`"h\303\244yh\303\244.txt"`). The old parser stripped the surrounding
 *      quotes and then `JSON.stringify`d the still-escaped string, so the
 *      shell received literal backslashes and `git add` exited 128. The quote
 *      stripping was only ever correct for the space case. `-z` never quotes.
 *
 *   3. **Staged renames.** The old comment claimed rename entries "stage both
 *      sides"; staging the OLD side of an already-staged rename is exactly
 *      what git rejects, because that path exists neither on disk nor in the
 *      index. `git mv` in a worktree exited 128. Note `-z` also REVERSES the
 *      field order (`R  <new>\0<old>\0`) — verified on this fixture, not
 *      assumed from the man page.
 *
 *   4. **`git apply --index` is all-or-nothing twice over.** One rejected hunk
 *      discarded the entire patch, so a workstream whose other nine files
 *      applied cleanly contributed nothing; and the failure `return`ed from
 *      inside the per-workstream loop, so later workstreams were never
 *      attempted at all. Worse, the early return left repoRoot on the feature
 *      branch with 0..N-1 workstreams already applied and no rollback.
