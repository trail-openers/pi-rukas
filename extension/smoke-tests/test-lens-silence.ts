/**
 * Silence is not approval — the #328 defect class, at the lens gate.
 *
 * A lens whose spawns all FAIL is correctly `blocked`, and one blocked lens
 * makes the whole review `REVIEW_INCOMPLETE` (`lens-review.ts:133`). That half
 * already worked.
 *
 * The gap is the lens that exits 0 and says nothing. `extractFindings` reads
 * `report_finding` tool calls; the lens prompt is explicit that "only the
 * `report_finding` tool calls count" and asks for a prose summary as the final
 * reply. A child that emitted neither — wrong model, dropped reporter
 * extension, out of context, or simply answered "ok" — produced
 * `{findings: [], blocked: false}`, byte-identical to a careful review that
 * genuinely found nothing.
 *
 * So the six-pass review could be a six-way no-op and still report APPROVED,
 * and no operator could tell from the summary. The fix asks for the positive
 * evidence the prompt already requests: zero findings AND no summary is not
 * clean, it is unreviewed.
