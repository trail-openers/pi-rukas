/**
 * lens-flank-escape-probe — the parts of `mentionsPath` that every other
 * coverage fixture leaves unpinned.
 *
 * `mentionsPath` in `lens-review-coverage.ts` is
 * `(?:^|NOT_PATH)ESCAPED(?:(?!PATH_CHAR)NOT_LINE_BREAK|TERMINATOR?(?:\r?\n|$))`.
 * Two of its parts were mutation-invisible before these cases:
 *
 *   - the LEFT flank. There is NO dedicated `\n` alternative and never should
 *     be read into one: the left flank is `(^|NOT_PATH)`, and `NOT_PATH` is a
 *     NEGATED class (`[^A-Za-z0-9_./+-]`) that already matches a newline. A
 *     bare `\n` left neighbour therefore satisfies the LEFT flank through
 *     `NOT_PATH` (or, at the very start of the summary, through `^`). The
 *     `\n|` alternative that used to sit in that alternation was UNREACHABLE
 *     product code and is deleted (2026-11-03 — see MUTATION PROOF below);
 *     deleting it left the whole coverage suite green. `NL_OPEN` is kept as a
 *     `BEHAVIOUR pin — a citation whose only left boundary is a line start must
 *     keep accounting — and is NOT evidence for any separate arm. It is not
 *     decoration either: excluding newline from `NOT_PATH` reddens it (see
 *     MUTATION PROOF below).
 *   - the escape class `[.*+?^${}()|[\]\\]`. Every denominator path in the
 *     other fixtures is regex-inert, so narrowing the class to `/\./g` passed
 *     the whole suite before these cases existed. `src/(legacy).ts` is not
 *     inert: unescaped, `(legacy)` collapses to an EMPTY CAPTURE GROUP and
 *     each `.` becomes a SINGLE-character wildcard (one character, not a run —
 *     the earlier version of this header said "runs", which is why its
 *     fixture could never match), so `META_UNESCAPED_FIT` supplies text that
 *     fits the UNESCAPED pattern while never naming the file. That negative
 *     case is what makes `META_CITED` a real one: with a dot-only escape the
 *     positive case can still be satisfied by an over-permissive match, and
 *     the negative case is the one that says so.
 *
 * MUTATION PROOF — the `NOT_PATH` and escape-class rows below were measured
 * 2026-11-01 against the shipped `mentionsPath`, each by editing
 * `lens-review-coverage.ts`, running the cases, and restoring the file
 * byte-identically (`git hash-object` matched HEAD's blob after every
 * restore: `ec2f4039`). The `\n|`-deletion row, the exclude-newline row and
 * the `^`-deletion row were re-measured against the post-deletion file,
 * restored the same way (`be64095a` after the last restore). Verdicts below
 * are what the run printed; nothing here is claimed from reasoning.
 *   - delete `\n|` from the left flank        → suite stays GREEN (P: 5 F: 0),
 *     which is the redundancy proof: the alternative was unreachable, so no
 *     fixture could redden on its removal. (2026-11-03, after the header above
 *     was written; the earlier claim in this block — "REDS: NL_OPEN alone" —
 *     was measured never to hold and is corrected here.)
 *   - exclude `\r`/`\n` from `NOT_PATH` while the `\n|` arm was still present
 *     (`[^A-Za-z0-9_./+\-\r\n]`) → NL_OPEN stayed GREEN (P: 1 F: 0): the
 *     explicit `\n` alternative was carrying it. That row and the one below
 *     are the pair that identifies what the fixture witnesses — take away
 *     BOTH ways the left flank can match a newline (the arm, and the negated
 *     class) and only then does it go red.
 *   - exclude `\r`/`\n` from `NOT_PATH` in the POST-DELETION file (`[^A-Za-z0-9_./+\-\r\n]`, i.e. make
 *     the left flank NOT match a newline) → NL_OPEN **FAILS** (`P: 0 F: 1`,
 *     the only red is the NL_OPEN canary). So `NL_OPEN` DOES witness something:
 *     it witnesses that the left flank admits a line-initial path — which, now
 *     the `\n|` alternative is gone, is `NOT_PATH`'s job. `^` does NOT rescue
 *     it: `^` matches only at index 0, and NL_OPEN's left boundary is index 19,
 *     which `NOT_PATH` admits.
 *     Conclusion: the fixture is
 *     not decoration (it can go red), but what it witnesses is the negated
 *     class, not a dedicated arm.
 *   - delete `^` from the left flank — left flank becomes `(?:NOT_PATH)`, i.e.
 *     the flank requires a character before the path — → 4 of
 *     `test-lens-coverage-denominator.ts`'s
 *     64 assertions go RED (measured again 2026-11-03: 64 GREEN under the
 *     shipped file, 60 GREEN + 4 RED under the mutant; the 64 is a `grep -c`
 *     of `assert(` in the shipped test file, which is what the harness runs,
 *     not a hand count): the plain-citation cases at `:79` and `:89` (left
 *     neighbour is a SPACE), the unaccounted-file canary, and `CARET_OPEN`
 *     below. The last of those is the `^`-exclusive one: its assertion is
 *     distinguishable from `:79`/`:89` by its own text, which quotes the
 *     fixture summary (`a path that starts the summary itself is a citation —
 *     the one position NOT_PATH cannot supply a neighbour for
 *     ("src/c.ts is fine")`), so a red line naming a summary is this case and
 *     a red line that names no summary is one of the space-neighbour cases.
 *     `CARET_OPEN` is the witness: it is GREEN with `^` and RED with `^`
 *     deleted, so the `^` alternative is load-bearing. It was not, until its
 *     summary lost a leading `\n` — see that fixture's rationale. (2026-11-03.)
 *   - narrow the escape class to `/\./g`      → REDS: META_CITED **and**
 *     META_UNESCAPED_FIT (2 red). An earlier version of this header asserted
 *     the opposite — "META_CITED stays green, which is the point of pairing
 *     them" — and that was measured never to hold: the pairing is worth
 *     having, but BOTH halves move, so neither is the canary for the other.
 *   - remove the escape entirely (`file` raw) → REDS: META_CITED and
 *     META_UNESCAPED_FIT again, and META_UNESCAPED_FIT's OLD text
 *     (`"Reviewed srccclegacycts and fixed it"`) stays GREEN under all three
 *     regimes — shipped, dot-only, and unescaped. It could never fail: the
 *     unescaped pattern needs a literal `/` and `srccclegacycts` has none, and
 *     `.` is a one-character wildcard, so the 14-character string cannot fill
 *     a 15-character pattern. An assertion that cannot go red under any
 *     mutation of the code it tests is not a test.
 *
 * Each case is `[summary, denominatorFile, expectedClaim, why]`; the test
 * asserts `accountedFiles([row({ summary })], new Set([file]))?.get(file)`.
 * The denominators here are single-file sets on purpose: these cases pin how a
 * path is MATCHED, not what the round's denominator is, and a one-file set
 * keeps a red assertion unambiguous about which flank moved.
