/**
 * #638 — the gap-gate grounding-source third outcome: greenfield convergence.
 *
 * The ticket's field bug: on a repo whose spec's claims are about its OWN
 * not-yet-existing code, the gate's severity legend leaves the reviewer no
 * honest outcome except CRITICAL (whose definition included "the stated
 * approach cannot work"), so the reviewer manufactures a new CRITICAL every
 * round (the ratchet) and the gate never files. The fix is prompt-side
 * (plan-gate-prompt.ts: the third-outcome vocabulary UNGROUNDED: and the
 * CRITICAL narrowing to spec-internal contradictions/impossibilities) plus
 * a parser channel (plan-gaps.ts: parseGaps returns ungrounded[] and
 * runGapGateLoop's review-unparseable branch exempts an all-ungrounded
 * round).
 *
 * This file owns the parser-side and pipeline-side regression tests for
 * that outcome:
 *
 *   - the UNGROUNDED: marker is parsed into its own channel (not as a
 *     gap, not as a severity word) and is mutually exclusive with GAP: in
 *     both directions
 *   - an all-ungrounded + VERDICT: READY reply is a GENUINE clean (the
 *     review-unparseable branch does NOT fire, no retry, no cap) and the
 *     pipeline files in ONE dispatch
 *   - an all-ungrounded + no verdict reply is still unreviewed (the D3
 *     posture: silence must not pass a spec its reviewer never concluded)
 *   - the ratchet shape (one new CRITICAL "cannot be confirmed" per round)
 *     is now the prompt's job to prevent — the parser/loop behaviour for a
 *     reply that DOES write a CRITICAL is unchanged (CRITICAL-only
 *     terminal rule, PR #637: unresolved-blocking, never files)
 *   - a world-claim the reviewer cannot verify travels as HIGH (files with
 *     residual disclosure, one dispatch) — the per-claim narrowing, not a
 *     global switch
 *
 * The prompt-side wording assertions (the CRITICAL legend, the
 * UNGROUNDED: instruction, the conditional Scope Discipline exemptions,
 * the no-repo-classification invariant) live in
 * test-plan-prompt-contract.ts — the two files are one unit by design
 * (the #664 lesson: the prompt text and its contract test move together).
