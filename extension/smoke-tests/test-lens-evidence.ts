/**
 * Evidence supply and the blocking threshold.
 *
 * ## Why evidence supply exists
 *
 * The reviewed diff is built from `origin/<base>..origin/<branch>`
 * (`work-driver-diff.ts` → `readIntegratedDiff`), but the lens children run
 * with `cwd` set to a worktree, and `readAllMergedDiffs` records the invariant
 * that those "stay DETACHED at baseSha". So a reviewer that opens a changed
 * file reads the version from BEFORE the change — and `role-tools.ts` strips
 * only write/edit/multiedit, so reviewers very much can open files.
 *
 * That is what let a documentation paragraph contradicting another paragraph in
 * the same file pass six lenses: the contradicting line was outside the diff,
 * and the file on disk was the pre-change copy. The first block here builds a
 * REAL git repo in that exact configuration and asserts the supplied content is
 * the branch version.
 *
 * ## Why the threshold is here too
 *
 * A lens assigns severity; the project decides which severity blocks. That was
 * hardcoded, and `AGENTS.md §1`'s "blocking at MEDIUM and above" was read by
 * nobody. The rule differs from merge authority ON PURPOSE: authority fails
 * closed, configuration falls back to the default — because a repo with no
 * AGENTS.md at all is the normal case, not an error.
