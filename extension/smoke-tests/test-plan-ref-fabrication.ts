/**
 * #638 deliverable 3 (task-b) — the reference-kind grounding contract and
 * the REF_RE prose-fallback honesty, unit-tested in isolation.
 *
 * The `reference` kind was fabricatable on an empty repo: its definition
 * ("a file/pattern already in the work area") admitted no honest value, so
 * the model invented paths — through TWO independent channels:
 *
 *   1. the two definitional copies (the report_plan_item TypeBox schema in
 *      plan-reporter.ts and the shared PLAN_REPORTER_PROMPT "Kind meanings"
 *      block in plan-angles.ts, which every angle task text composes) —
 *      both must now state the grounding constraint (existence confirmed by
 *      a live tool call in this session) and the honest-absence carve-out,
 *      and both must agree;
 *   2. draftSpec's REF_RE prose fallback — when an angle emitted zero
 *      structured reference items, every path-shaped token in its prose
 *      rendered with the suffix "existing pattern or affected surface;
 *      verify before editing", labelling invented paths as real code. The
 *      fallback survives (it is the DEFAULT path for an honest greenfield
 *      angle) but no longer attributes existence.
 *
 * No dispatch stubs: this suite drives the exported seams directly
 * (REFERENCE_KIND_DEFS, anglePromptsFor, draftSpec, extractPlanItems).
