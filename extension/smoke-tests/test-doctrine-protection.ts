/**
 * #406 — a cycle could grant itself merge authority.
 *
 * `resolveMergeAuthority` read `<repoRoot>/AGENTS.md` from the working tree,
 * and the only caller runs at the `merged` step — *after* `commit-pr` has
 * integrated the developer subagents' patches into `repoRoot`. So a developer
 * that wrote one sentence into AGENTS.md had it integrated by the driver's own
 * consolidation and then read back as permission. Nothing in `src/` protected
 * that file. Amp shipped a CVE for this shape.
 *
 * The first block below is the canary: it builds a real git repo whose base
 * commit forbids merging, writes a grant into the working-tree copy exactly as
 * a subagent would, and asserts the gate is unmoved. It also asserts, against
 * the same repo, that reading the working tree *does* flip to granted — so the
 * test proves the vulnerability is real rather than just that the fix compiles.
 * Revert `readDoctrineAtBase` to an `fs.readFile` and this file fails.
