/**
 * #357 — adversarial phase wall-clock budget: work-driver integration tests.
 *
 * Split from test-work-driver-adversarial-retry.ts (AGENTS.md §12
 * file-size limit).
 *
 * task-a added adversarialPhaseBudgetMs() and a wall-clock budget check in
 * runPhaseWithInfraRetry so a repeated inactivity-watchdog kill cannot
 * consume its full attempt budget (default 30 min ceiling per phase).
 *
 * These tests cover:
 *
 *  T7 — PI_ENSEMBLE_ADVERSARIAL_PHASE_BUDGET_MS env-var accessibility:
 *       the env var overrides the default; the documented default is 30
 *       minutes; 0 disables the budget. The env var is the operator's only
 *       control surface for the inner phase budget (the inner loop is not
 *       separately injectable from the outer adversarialLoopFn seam).
 *
 *  T8 — N=1, permanent inactivity kill — attempt count bounded and
 *       elapsed time proportional. The outer retry layers (inner-fanout
 *       per-workstream budget ADVERSARIAL_PER_WS_MAX_RETRIES + step-level
 *       RETRY_ONCE) give a maximum of ADVERSARIAL_PER_WS_MAX_RETRIES+2
 *       total outer calls. The assertion is on exact attempt count so any
 *       regression that increases retries fails loudly, and on elapsed
 *       time so the bound is proportional to attempt count rather than
 *       just "it eventually returned".
 *
 * No real Pi spawn happens; all adversarialLoopFn calls are mocked.
 * The inner per-phase budget (adversarialPhaseBudgetMs from task-a) limits
 * retries inside each outer call; the outer call count tested here is the
 * second layer.

// fix dispatch was killed by the watchdog and the cycle consumed 47 minutes.
//
// Retry layers and their total contribution to outer adversarialLoopFn calls:
//
//   Layer A (inner fanout per-workstream): the fanout treats an inactivity
//   kill without errorStop as `provider-severed` (isTransientAdversarialOutcome
//   returns true), so it retries ADVERSARIAL_PER_WS_MAX_RETRIES times within
//   one outer step pass. Current value = 2, giving 3 inner calls.
//
//   Layer B (step-level RETRY_ONCE): the transient budget for inactivity is
//   maxRetries=1. After the inner fanout returns infra-failure once, the
//   step-level RETRY_ONCE fires, giving one more outer step pass with 1 inner
//   call (inner budget already at 2/2).
//
//   Total: 3 (pass A) + 1 (pass B) = ADVERSARIAL_PER_WS_MAX_RETRIES + 2 = 4.
//

// regression that adds retries — e.g. a budget increase that re-enables a
