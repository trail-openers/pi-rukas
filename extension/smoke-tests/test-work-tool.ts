/**
 * PM must be able to START a cycle, and must not be able to authorise a merge.
 *
 * The incident: a PM killed a `/work` cycle over `needs-human-attention`
 * labels, found no way to start another, and reimplemented the driver by hand
 * — no state file, no queue, no handoff artifact, no review-cap timer, and a
 * branch the driver knew nothing about. Doctrine forbidding that already
 * existed; the thing to call instead did not.
 *
 * The hard constraint on the way in: `--merge` is one of two `AuthoritySource`s
 * and the only one that bypasses the #406/#407 policy judge. An LLM-settable
 * boolean there is a cycle granting itself merge authority. So the tool has no
 * such parameter, and no path through it can set the grant.
