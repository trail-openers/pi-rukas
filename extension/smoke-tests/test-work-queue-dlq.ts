 * #368 — a failed group parks; the queue continues.
 *
 * The regression this locks down is the most operator-visible failure the
 * harness has: `/work` over 13 issues died on #279 and left **11 unrelated
 * groups unstarted**. A three-issue batch halted on its second item while the
 * third was independently ready. Since 69% of the triggering failures are
 * provider infrastructure (#366), the queue was usually stopped by something
 * with no bearing on the remaining work.
