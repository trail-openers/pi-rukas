/**
 * #612 S4 task-b — the in-process handoff fallback is now forge-aware.
 *
 * Pre-migration, `runHandoff`'s fallback (the path that fires when the ops
 * dispatch fails or outlives its bound) shelled out to raw `gh` via a
 * module-local `execp`: `gh issue|pr comment --body-file`, `gh label create`,
 * `gh issue|pr edit --add-label`. No injection seam, no offline test.
 *
 * The forge adapter (S2, #610) normalizes those calls behind a `Forge`
 * interface. This test drives the fallback with a fake `Forge` (injected via
 * `ctx.forge`, the new DriverContext seam) and a failing `dispatchFn`, and
 * asserts:
 *
 *   - The forge's `issueComment` is called for the issue target (no PR).
 *   - The forge's `labelCreate` + `labelAdd("issue", ...)` are called.
 *   - The handoff-emitted event records the parsed comment URL.
 *   - The label is recorded as applied.
