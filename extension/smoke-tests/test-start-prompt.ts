/**
 * #390 — `/start` must see what `/work` left behind, and must stay runnable.
 *
 * Two separate things are checked here, and the second is the one that rots.
 *
 * `/start` reads git status, issues, PRs and CI at session open, and until
 * #390 it never read `.pi/work-state/`. So the most actionable state in the
 * repo — the cycles that stopped last night waiting on a human — was
 * invisible at exactly the moment the operator decides what to do. Groups
 * that never started are worse: they leave no state file and no PR, so
 * `queue-summary.json` (#382) is the only record they existed.
 *
 * The second check is the file's own bash rule. `permission-guard` DENIES any
 * command containing `&&`, `||`, `;`, `|`, `>`, backticks or `$(…)`, and a
 * denied command does not fail loudly — it falls through, and the step
 * silently produces nothing. So a future edit that innocently writes
 * `cat x | head` would disable that step with no visible symptom. This test
 * is the only thing that would catch it.
