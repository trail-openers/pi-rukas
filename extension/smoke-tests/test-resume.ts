/**
 * #382 — a crash mid-dispatch used to lose the cycle silently.
 *
 * The resume machinery was declared but inert: `resumable: false` was a
 * literal in the TYPE, `inFlightJobIds` was validated and rendered but never
 * written, and `dispatch-started` was never emitted at all — so the validator
 * that cross-checks them could only ever pass vacuously. State was persisted
 * only at step boundaries while a dispatch can run for thirty minutes, so a
 * crash inside that window left the file at the PREVIOUS boundary still
 * saying `running`. A dead cycle and a live one looked identical, forever.
 *
 * The tests below kill the driver mid-dispatch for real (the injected
 * `dispatchFn` throws a marker after the write-ahead has hit disk) and then
 * re-invoke it, because that is the only way to observe what a crash actually
 * leaves behind. Live evidence this matters: `.pi/work-state/547.json` and
 * `551.json` in this repo are stuck at `status: "running"` with empty event
 * logs — cycles that died and can never be resumed or diagnosed.
