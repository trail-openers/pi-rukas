/**
 * The gap gate FAILS CLOSED on an unparseable review (operator bug report,
 * 2026-09-09: the synthetic `[MEDIUM] no structured gaps parsed → proceed`
 * gap made an unreadable review a guaranteed pass under CRITICAL-only
 * blocking — fired twice in six fixture rounds, both escapes filed real
 * contradictions).
 *
 * Pins the report's outcome table:
 *   valid + 0 findings            → Reviewed  → FILED, dispositions '(none)'
 *   valid + MEDIUM/LOW only       → Reviewed  → FILED with residual
 *   valid + ≥1 CRITICAL           → Reviewed  → BLOCKED (cap-surface)
 *   empty reply                   → Unavail.  → NOT filed (review-unparseable)
 *   prose, no markers, no verdict → Unavail.  → NOT filed (after ONE strict retry)
 *   truncated (gaps, no verdict)  → Reviewed  → D3 handling (CRITICAL blocks)
 *   dispatch failure              → Unavail.  → NOT filed (gate-unavailable)
 * ...and the load-bearing invariant: NO reply shape reaches `filed: true`
 * without a parsed review (a verdict line or GAP: findings).
