/**
 * #475 — worktreeCreate's pre-remove must not silently destroy uncommitted work.
 *
 * `worktreeCreate` force-removes an existing worktree at the same path so a
 * resumed cycle is not wedged by its own leftover. A developer IS supposed
 * to commit in the worktree per #453/#621, but a cycle that died
 * mid-implementation — before the commit — still leaves its diff uncommitted
 * in the worktree: not in the object database, unrecoverable. The
 * force-remove destroyed it with no warning.
 *
 * Now: `inspectWorktreeForLoss` checks the leftover BEFORE the remove
 * (porcelain + commits ahead of the base). Dirty → `DirtyWorktreeError`
 * naming the absolute path; `mechanizedBranchSetup` re-throws it, and
 * `runBranch` routes it to handoff via a `step-failed:branch` cap instead of
 * falling back to the ops dispatch — whose prompt would destroy the same
 * work through the same `--force`.
 *
 * The common path is untouched: a leftover with no uncommitted work and no
 * unpushed commits is removed as before. Verified twice — with real git
 * (the load-bearing evidence) and with an injected exec (the refusal must not
 * fall back to the LLM path).
 *
 * #536 — `worktreeCreate` now returns `{ path, provision }` so the branch
 * step can emit a `worktree-provisioned` event per workstream. The common-path
 * canary here is updated to assert on `result.path` (the prior `created ===
 * wt` shape). The injected `runBranch` clean-path case adds an assertion that
 * a `worktree-provisioned` event lands in the event log.
