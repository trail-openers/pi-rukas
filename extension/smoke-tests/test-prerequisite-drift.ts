/**
 * Prerequisite-drift gate — #489.
 *
 * Three sources describe pi-ensemble's prerequisites and they already
 * disagree on main: the README Prerequisites section declares a set of CLIs,
 * install.sh's REQUIRED_CLIS array checks a different set (bun and
 * codebase-memory-mcp are absent from it), and the Dockerfile's
 * global-install lines name yet another. The drift was found by manual audit
 * — nothing detects it. The gate compares the SETS, not hardcoded counts, so
 * docs may reflow freely and only a genuinely missing or unexplained name
 * fails.
 *
 * Directions:
 *   forward  — every REQUIRED_CLIS name appears somewhere in the README
 *              Prerequisites section (a presence check, not markdown-table
 *              row parsing, so prose and formatting stay free to change).
 *   reverse  — every global install in .devcontainer/Dockerfile names either
 *              a REQUIRED_CLIS entry or an EXCEPTIONS key.
 *
 * EXCEPTIONS is a Record<string, string> following the NOT_FOR_PM shape
 * (test-pm-tool-permissions.ts): an entry is a decision, not an oversight.
 * It ships PRE-SEEDED with today's three known divergences, each referencing
 * the docs issue to fix it. Each seeded entry is deleted as that docs fix
 * lands — a stale entry is dead config that hides a typo in a live one.
 *
 * Proven in both directions (AGENTS.md §12: "a gate never observed to fail
 * is worthless"): a static fixture pair under fixtures/ where one side
 * declares a tool the other omits is flagged by the SAME exported functions
 * the real check uses.
 *
 * Escape hatch: PI_ENSEMBLE_PREREQ_DRIFT=0.
