/**
 * Gate-never-ran must not file an unreviewed spec (PR #635 lens MEDIUM 1).
 *
 * When the gap-gate dispatch FAILS (`!gate.ok` or `gate.errorStop`), the loop
 * `break`s. Before the fix, `capHit`, `capReason` and `residualForDisclosure`
 * were all left unset, and the Phase-5 guard is
 *
 *     !dryRun && capReason !== "unresolved-blocking"
 *
 * `undefined !== "unresolved-blocking"` is TRUE, so the spec FILED even though
 * the gap gate never reviewed it. No gap dispositions, no cap reason, no
 * filing failure — the operator could not distinguish it from a clean READY.
 *
 * This is the exact failure class the compiled /plan pipeline exists to
 * eliminate. D3 stops "verdict absent → pass"; this is "gate never ran →
 * pass", sitting two branches away.
 *
 * The fix adds a fourth capReason member, `gate-unavailable`, set in the
 * dispatch-failure branch, and does NOT file — the spec is surfaced to the
 * operator with the gate's failure reason, matching the deliberate-skip shape
 * `cap-surface` already uses. Rationale: we cannot assert a spec is clean
 * when nothing reviewed it, and the all-angles-failed path already halts for
 * the same reason.
