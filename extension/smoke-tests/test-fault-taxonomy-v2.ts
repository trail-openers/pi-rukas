/**
 * #366 — 429 classification by the provider's own requested delay.
 *
 * Every message below is a VERBATIM string captured from this machine's
 * `.pi/work-state/*.json` event logs. Synthesising plausible-looking provider
 * text would test the regex against itself; these are what the provider
 * actually sent when cycles died.
 *
 * The failure being fixed: a per-minute token bucket and a 24-hour quota
 * exhaustion arrive as the same status code, differing only in a number the
 * driver never read. Both killed the cycle with "retrying cannot help" —
 * which for the 60s case is simply false, and cost issue #279's cycle $7.08
 * plus 11 unstarted downstream issues.
