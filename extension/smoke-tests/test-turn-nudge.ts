/**
 * #546 AC4 — the opt-in soft turn-count nudge (~80 turns).
 *
 * A long dispatch dying mid-stream is cheap to recover from IF the child
 * wrote a status summary first: recovery is "survey disk + resume dispatch
 * with the full contract", not a blind re-run. The nudge exists so that at
 * the turn count where a mid-stream death stops being surprising, the child
 * is reminded to keep its status current.
 *
 * Design (matches the AC): STEER-ONLY — no killCause, no kill, no cap
 * interaction. It rides the existing #543 F2 `onSteer` seam (the same seam
 * the F1 loop detector and F6 token budget use) and fires at most once per
 * dispatch. It is DEFAULT-OFF: `PI_ENSEMBLE_TURN_NUDGE` unset/`0`/garbage →
 * inert; `1` → on at the module constant `TURN_NUDGE_AT = 80`.
 *
 * Why 80: the #546 corpus of long-dispatch mid-stream deaths (95-min silent
 * solo reviewer, 159-turn fix developer, 231-turn lens-mediums fix
 * developer) all sit above it, and every healthy short run in the same
 * corpus ends with a structured summary well below it — so the nudge is a
 * no-op for the runs that were never at risk, and lands with margin before
 * the smallest observed death.
 *
 * Why steer-only / no cap coupling: the nudge is a REMINDER, not a bound.
 * Gating it on `PI_ENSEMBLE_DISPATCH_CAPS` or the ops-role exemption would
 * conflate a courtesy with a kill authority; a long ops run is precisely
 * where a status line is cheapest to write, so ops children get it too
 * (when a job is attached to carry the lifecycle line).
