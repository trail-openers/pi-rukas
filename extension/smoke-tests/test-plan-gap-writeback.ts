/**
 * #639 DEFECT 2 — Decision-A writeback pipeline tests.
 *
 * Decision A makes the gap-gate writeback real and three-branch:
 *   1. body-applicable resolution (no section named, or the default AC
 *      section) → appended as a NEW bullet there (with the provenance
 *      marker), Open Questions renders `status: resolved` (owner PM).
 *   2. a resolution naming a DIFFERENT section → the bullet goes there.
 *   3. placeholder, unrenderable section, or an EDIT-IMPERATIVE resolution
 *      (delete/remove/replace/reword/rewrite/instead — vipune rounds 8+9)
 *      → `status: open`, `decision owner: operator`, body NOT modified.
 *
 * The round-2 gate prompt must be built from the RE-DRAFTED body (the
 * makeGatePrompt thunk closes over the reassigned `body` in onCorrective).
 * Single-round corrective shape only (GAP_GATE_MAX_ITERATIONS = 2). Seam
 * wiring lives in the shared plan-test-stubs.ts.
