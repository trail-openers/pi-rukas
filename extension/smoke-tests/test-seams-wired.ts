/**
 * A shipped module with no caller is not a feature.
 *
 * `extension/src/vipune.ts` shipped twice — calibrated, documented and fully
 * tested — imported by **nothing but its own smoke tests**. Every measurement
 * that made it correct was real; none of it ever ran. `memory-stats.ts` then
 * shipped in v0.12.32 the same way. Tests of a module in isolation cannot
 * detect this, because they are themselves the only caller.
 *
 * So this file asserts the one thing those tests structurally cannot: that each
 * seam is reachable from production, and that every export either has a
 * production caller or sits on a written-down list naming the issue that will
 * wire it.
 *
 * The allowlist is the point. It turns "this is dead" from something nobody
 * notices into a number that has to shrink, and shipping a new export without
 * either wiring it or declaring it becomes a failure rather than a habit.
 *
 * Generalised from the vipune-only version after the pattern recurred a third
 * time: `retry-config-check.ts` was written, tested, wired — and the wiring was
 * then reverted by a stray `git checkout`, leaving a module that passed its own
 * suite while doing nothing. One seam is an incident; three is a class.
