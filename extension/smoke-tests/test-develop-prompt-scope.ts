/**
 * A single-workstream developer is still a developer with a scope.
 *
 * `inlineDevelopPrompt` gated the whole scope block on
 * `workstream && workstreamId && workstreamId !== "default"`, and `runDevelop`
 * passes `ids.length > 1 ? id : undefined` — so on an N=1 cycle the developer
 * saw none of it: not the scope sentence, not the in-scope file list, not the
 * out-of-scope fence, and not the vipune memory brief.
 *
 * Measured on this host: **all 16 `.pi/work-state/*.json` files are N=1.** So on
 * every real cycle the plan step produced a scope fence that was then thrown
 * away, and the memory brief — an ~8s vipune retrieval the driver pays for
 * before every develop dispatch — was computed and discarded.
 *
 * The multi-workstream framing ("one of multiple developers running in
 * parallel") is genuinely N>1-only. The scope itself is not.
