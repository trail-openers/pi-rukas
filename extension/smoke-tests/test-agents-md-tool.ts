/**
 * tool — the #526 in-process delivery for /agents-md.
 *
 * `registerAgentsMdTools` is the fix for #524's delivery defect: the prose
 * body told PM to run `bun extension/src/agents-md/agents-md.ts` — a path
 * relative to the HOST repo, which has no extension/ directory. The tool
 * reaches the same verbs in-process, resolving the repo root from
 * `ctx.cwd` (work-entry's `resolveRepoRoot`), never `process.cwd()`.
 *
 * This test drives the real registered tool with a fake ExtensionAPI and a
 * stubbed FsOps, asserting:
 *   - each verb reaches its verb function with a resolved repo root
 *   - the structured result shape (details: verb, exitCode, plan/check/error)
 *   - dryRun is honored through the tool (plan.newBytes returned, no writeFile)
 *   - `deep: true` on create is rejected with a structured error
 *   - the unified diff in the report is insertions-only for a create
