/**
 * #483 — the plan step must not split a test from the file it exercises.
 *
 * `runDevelop` fans one developer per workstream into its own detached
 * worktree. When the plan puts a test in one workstream and its subject in
 * another, the test provably cannot run against the implementation: each
 * workstream passes its own develop gate, and the first verification that
 * sees both is the consolidated tree at commit-pr — after the full develop
 * and adversarial spend, with the same failure the split guaranteed.
 *
 * Observed live on issue #479: task-a → `build.sh`, task-b →
 * `extension/smoke-tests/test-build-list-dedup.ts`. The test asserted
 * against the shape of a file it had never seen.
 *
 * This is a plan-quality defect of exactly the shape `planQualityReason`
 * already models, so it becomes a fourth reason and inherits the existing
 * one-shot corrective re-dispatch. The planner can re-split; a halt would
 * be more code and a worse outcome.
