/**
 * #633 Group B — D1/D2/D7 pipeline-level tests for the /plan gap gate.
 *
 * Split out of test-plan-tool.ts (which is at the 500-line limit) to keep
 * both files under the hard cap. These tests exercise the pipeline end-to-
 * end through the dispatch + forge seams:
 *
 *   - D1: the cap message names the ACTUAL cause (MEDIUM-only NEEDS_ITERATION
 *     burns the cap → the message must NOT claim "unresolved CRITICAL/HIGH
 *     gaps remain")
 *   - D2: at the cap, zero CRITICAL → FILE with residual disclosure
 *     (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW travel in the residual section); CRITICAL remaining →
 *     do NOT file, surface to the operator. #664 transposed: the terminal
 *     rule is CRITICAL-only — a ratcheting stream of fresh HIGH findings can
 *     no longer prevent filing
 *   - D7: filing failures carry a DISCRIMINATED reason (forge-unresolved,
 *     create-error with stderr, empty-url) on the result and in the
 *     operator-visible text
 *
 * The corrective-round tests (NO-OP, CRITICAL-STILL-ITERATES, UNION,
 * re-pointed RATCHETING) are in test-plan-gap-gate-rounds.ts.
 *
 * The pure parsing seam (parseGaps / verdictParsed / draftSpec status) is
 * unit-tested in test-plan-gap-parser.ts. The registration + dryRun seam is
 * in test-plan-tool.ts.
