/**
 * #546 — long-dispatch mid-stream deaths arrive looking like partial success.
 *
 * Three subagents died mid-stream during the #543/#544 session (95-min silent
 * reviewer, 159-turn fix developer, 231-turn lens-mediums developer). Each was
 * recovered by surveying disk state and re-dispatching with the full contract
 * — but only because a human noticed. The report read like partial success.
 *
 * AC1: a report whose final text is a truncated tool-narration line (no
 * completion-shaped summary) on a long run (> 80 turns) is tagged
 * POSSIBLY-TRUNCATED in both report shapes.
 * AC2: the taxonomy distinguishes "mid-stream truncation with on-disk work"
 * from a provider error and suggests the resume-from-disk pattern.
 *
 * Detection is intentionally conservative: false positives cost one "verify on
 * disk" line; false negatives reproduce the original failure.
