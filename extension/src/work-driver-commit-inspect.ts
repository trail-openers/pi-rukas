/**
 * work-driver-commit-inspect — #500: post-facto repoRoot inspection for the
 * commit-pr step.
 *
 * `mechanizedCommitPr` leaves repoRoot in a state it controls: `integrate()`
 * either succeeds (branch checked out, commit clean, pushed) or rolls back
 * via `restoreRoot()`. The LLM ops fallback, however, consolidates repoRoot
 * BY HAND — and issue #481's live cycle left it on the feature branch with
 * two `UU` paths and eight staged files, which `integrate()`'s dirty-repoRoot
 * preflight then refuses to touch, wedging every later cycle at commit-pr
 * with no explanation of why the tree is dirty.
 *
 * This module is the post-hoc inspection the fallback path never had: one
 * `git status --porcelain -z` + `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` after the
 * fallback dispatch completes, parsed into facts the handoff renderers
 * (`commitPrRoot` / `commitPrRootError` in pipelineState) render as the
 * branch, the unmerged paths, the staged count, and the exact command that
 * clears the state. It records what the cycle LEFT; it does not modify
 * repoRoot, and it deliberately does not reimplement `integrate()`'s
 * rollback — that already works (test-integrate-aborts.ts).
 *
 * Also owns `commitPrRootFactLines`, the single source of the recorded-state
 * fact lines (branch, unmerged paths, staged count, clearing command) shared
 * by BOTH handoff surfaces — the "agree by copy" shape that produced the
 * "adversarial-loop" default in 23 of 53 handoffs.
 *
 * Kept in its own file (not inlined into work-driver-commit.ts) because both
 * of the natural homes sat near the 500-line gate at the time of writing
 * (work-driver-commit.ts ~396, workflow-state-schema.ts ~466).

 * Parse `git status --porcelain -z` output into a `CommitPrRootState` (defined

 *
 * Porcelain format: `XY <path>\0` where X (col 1) is the staged state and Y
 * (col 2) the worktree state. Unmerged paths have X/Y ∈ {U, A, D, .} — in
 * practice `UU`, `AA`, `DD`, `AU`, `UA` etc. Untracked is `??`.
 * Rename/copy entries (`R ` / `C `) record a SECOND NUL-separated token —
 * the destination path — which is the one an operator can `git add` /
 * `git status` on; the parser consumes it so the old name is never counted
 * as an entry of its own.
 *
 * The `-z` (NUL-separated) form is load-bearing, for the same reason
 * work-driver-stage.ts uses it: the plain form C-quotes special-character
 * paths (`"src/we\\ttab.rs"`), and a recorded path is only useful if the
 * rendered clearing commands (`git add <path>` / `git checkout --theirs`) can
 * operate on it as-is. NUL-separated output never quotes.
 *
 * `stagedCount` counts entries with a non-space column 1 — the staged set
 * (`M `, `A `, `MM`, `M `, unmerged…). Untracked (`??`) is dirt the operator
 * sees in `totalEntries`, but it is not staged and the rendered
 * `git reset --hard` clearing command would not remove it.
