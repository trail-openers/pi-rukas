/**
 * work-tool — the two tools that let PM reach the compiled workflows.
 *
 * The incident these exist for: a PM killed a `/work` cycle over
 * `needs-human-attention` labels, found it had no way to start another, and
 * reimplemented the driver by hand. No state file, no queue, no handoff
 * artifact, no review-cap timer, and a branch the driver knew nothing about.
 * Every guarantee the compiled pipeline provides was silently absent, and
 * nothing in the transcript said so. Doctrine telling PM not to do that already
 * existed; what was missing was the thing to call instead.
 *
 * Two tools rather than five. Measured: `/research`, `/plan`, `/audit` and
 * `/review` are prose bodies sent to the main agent, and PM already owns every
 * tool those bodies orchestrate. A dedicated tool per command would be PM
 * prompting itself — a worse way to get text into context than simply returning
 * it. `load_workflow_doctrine` returns any command's body as a tool result, so
 * all of them are reachable without four redundant registrations.
 *
 * `start_work_driver` is the real gap, because `/work` is not prose: it is a
 * compiled state machine that must actually be invoked.
 *
 * `plan` is the SECOND compiled driver exclusion (#598). It used to be loadable
 * prose: PM could hand itself the 473-line /plan body and re-implement the
 * pipeline by hand — which is exactly what it did to file three non-trivial
 * issues inline in one session (#591/#592/#594). Issue creation is now gated
 * behind the `start_plan_driver` tool (plan-tool.ts), and the /plan slash
 * command is a thin alias that tells PM to call it. Handing PM the prose body
 * would reopen the door this module exists to close.
 *
 * **There is no `merge` parameter, deliberately.** `--merge` is one of two
 * `AuthoritySource`s and the only one bypassing the #406/#407 policy judge. An
 * LLM-settable boolean there is a cycle granting itself merge authority. Merge
 * authority stays operator-only: the slash command, or a grant in the project's
 * `AGENTS.md` that the judge verifies by citation.
 *
 * Tools receive an `ExtensionContext` as their fifth `execute` parameter — the
 * same object the command handler uses — so `ctx.cwd` is available and the
 * repo-root resolution is identical. (`ctx.isIdle()` is deliberately NOT
 * copied: a tool runs mid-turn by definition, so it would refuse always.)
