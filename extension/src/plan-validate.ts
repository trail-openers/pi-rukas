/**
 * plan-validate — deterministic validation of the drafted spec body, run
 * AFTER draftSpec and BEFORE the gap gate.
 *
 * The research base (outputs/spec-driven-plan-driver-gap.md, G4) notes the
 * pipeline's only deterministic checks were parser-level: a draft whose
 * load-bearing sections all fell back to placeholder strings could reach
 * the LLM gap gate (paying a reviewer dispatch to notice junk) or — for
 * the types the gate does not cover — the forge. These checks are free,
 * mechanical, and identical on every run.
 *
 * Deliberately NARROW (the all-angles-failed guard already catches total
 * junk; this catches the partial case where SOME angle produced items but
 * the load-bearing section still fell back):
 *
 *   - bug/feature: the Acceptance criteria section must not be the
 *     fallback placeholder — an issue with zero real ACs is not
 *     /work-consumable (work-driver-plan-helpers.ts counts AC lines).
 *   - epic (below the sub-issue depth limit): the Sub-issues section must
 *     contain an actual decomposition, and a sane number of entries.
 *   - chore/spike: no additional check. A spike has one angle, so a spike
 *     with no deliverable items is already the all-angles-failed halt; a
 *     chore's smallest-viable-change shape does not require structured ACs.
 *
 * Type/content plausibility ("is this feature really an epic?") is NOT
 * checked here — that is a judgment call, and deterministic heuristics for
 * it would trade false halts for nothing the gap gate does not already
 * cover.
 *
 * The fallback strings are declared HERE and imported by plan-draft.ts's
 * draftSpec — single source, so a reworded placeholder cannot silently
 * stop matching the validator.
