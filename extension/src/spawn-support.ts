/**
 * Runaway backstop — the outer bound on any child's wall clock.
 *
 * This replaced a table of six per-role numbers. They were raised twice —
 * #296 (the lens and ops caps sat below a single xhigh-thinking turn) and
 * #553 (a developer was 43 min into substantive work when the 30-min cap
 * SIGTERM'd it) — and both times the finding was identical: the number was
 * too small for a HEALTHY child. That is the signature of a bad metric rather
 * than a mistuned one. Provider speed varies by an order of magnitude, so no
 * wall-clock number means the same thing on two different models, and the
 * table had already drifted out of sync with its own documentation (the
 * troubleshooting matrix still claimed 15 min for lenses that were set to 45).
 *
 * Liveness is the model-independent signal, and `inactivityTimeoutMs` below is
 * the real hang detector. This constant exists only to stop a runaway loop —
 * a child that keeps emitting events while making no progress never trips
 * liveness — so it sits deliberately far above any legitimate runtime rather
 * than being tuned to one.
 *
