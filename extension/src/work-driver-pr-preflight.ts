/**
 * work-driver-pr-preflight — "does this issue already have an open PR?"
 *
 * The driver had no answer to that question. `runBranch` never looked, and
 * `mechanizedCommitPr` calls `gh pr create` unconditionally, so a cycle
 * started with `--restart` (which wipes the state file) treats an issue as
 * greenfield even when a PR for it is sitting open on GitHub.
 *
 * Live evidence — issue #5, 2026-08-05: PR #358 was open on
 * `feature/issue-5-surface-thinking-only-output` when `/work 5 --restart`
 * ran. The driver picked a near-identical slug
 * (`…-thinking-only-model-output`), rebuilt the whole issue, and merged that
 * as PR #359. #358 is now orphaned — its issue is closed, so it can never
 * auto-close — and the two implementations had diverged (#359 guards
 * `toolUses.length === 0`, #358 does not). A full cycle was paid for twice
 * and the winner was decided by merge order, not review.
 *
 * The load-bearing detail: the second cycle chose a DIFFERENT branch name,
 * so a branch-scoped lookup would not have caught it. The idempotency key
 * has to be the issue number (#362).
 *
 * This module only detects. Adopting an existing branch/PR and resuming into
 * it needs mechanized branch setup (#287); until then the driver halts with a
 * cap-hit and lets the operator decide, per §7 cap-hit doctrine.

/**
 * Match an open PR against an issue number, most-reliable signal first.

 * 1. A GitHub closing keyword in the body. `mechanizedCommitPr` writes
 *    `Fixes #<N>` for every active issue (work-driver-commit.ts), so this is
 *    exact for driver-authored PRs. `Closes` / `Resolves` are accepted too
 *    since human-authored PRs use them interchangeably.
 * 2. The head branch naming the issue. Catches human and pre-driver branches
 *    that never wrote a closing keyword.
 *
 * Both patterns reject a numeric continuation, so issue #5 does not match
 * `Fixes #55` or `feature/issue-55-…`.
 *
 * Known gap: for a bundled branch like `issues-85-111-114`, only the FIRST
 * issue matches by branch. The body check covers the rest for driver-authored
 * PRs, which is where bundling comes from in the first place.
