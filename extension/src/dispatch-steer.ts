/**
 * dispatch_steer — PM-callable mid-flight course correction for a running
 * subagent (#153).
 *
 * Use case: PM observes (typically via dispatch_peek) that a child is going
 * off-rails — rabbit hole, scope drift, time-box about to violate — and
 * injects a corrective message via Pi's RPC `steer` command.
 *
 * Mechanism:
 *   1. Look up the child's stdin from async-jobs.childHandles (set during
 *      spawn by the `onStdin` hook plumbed through WorkHooks)
 *   2. Write `{ type: "steer", message }\n` to that stdin
 *   3. Pi's --mode rpc agent receives the steer and queues it as the
 *      highest-priority next-turn input
 *   4. Emit a scrollback lifecycle entry so the user sees PM's interventions
 *
 * Discipline lives in the prompt layer (#154 — PM doctrine). NO mechanical
 * caps or cooldowns in this tool — same trust model as dispatch_peek.
 *
 * Failure modes the tool returns to PM:
 *   - "no such running job <id>" — the job either never existed, or already
 *     finished (handle cleaned up on settle). PM should NOT retry.
 *   - "delivery failed: <reason>" — stdin write error (e.g., EPIPE because
 *     the child exited between lookup and write). Race condition; PM treats
 *     like "job finished".

 *   - "driver-budget"        — the work-driver's token-budget cap (#543 F6).
 *   - "driver-turn-nudge"    — the #546 AC4 soft turn-count nudge (opt-in via
 *                              PI_ENSEMBLE_TURN_NUDGE=1; the ~80-turn reminder

 *                              to recover from if the child writes a status
 *                              summary before it ends).
 *   - "driver-success-keyed" — the #772 success-keyed repetition counter
 *                              (re-issuing an already-successful command with
 *                              identical output — the #753 incident shape). A
 *                              distinct source from "driver-loop-detector" so
 *                              the operator can tell which counter fired: a
 *                              success-keyed steer means the child is
 *                              re-running a GREEN command, not repeating
 *                              arguments.
 *
 * The PM tool path passes "pm-tool"; the driver's caps pass the other two.
 * The tag is informational — it tells the operator WHY the child was nudged.
