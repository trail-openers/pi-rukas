/**
 * Single-call dispatch surface for in-process orchestrators (the
 * work-driver — see workflow-state.ts / work-driver.ts).
 *
 * Wraps the same `startJob` + `spawnSpecialist` plumbing the PM-facing
 * dispatch tools use, but flagged as `ownerKind: "driver"` so async-jobs
 * skips the `pi.sendUserMessage(report, deliverAs:"steer")` step — the
 * caller awaits the returned promise instead. PM never sees an
 * `[ensemble:async]` it didn't initiate.
 *
 * Why this lives in dispatch.ts: the dispatch tools and the driver both
 * need the same spawn → progress → completion plumbing. Factoring this
 * one entry point keeps the spawn/abort/lifecycle semantics in one place
 * — adding a tool surface in the future means "register a new tool that
 * calls dispatchCore," not "build a parallel plumbing chain."
 *
 * Failure semantics: the promise resolves for ok/failed/errorStop
 * dispatches (failure is encoded in `result.ok` / `result.errorStop`). It
 * REJECTS only if the work function (spawnSpecialist) throws before any
 * DispatchResult is produced — i.e. spawn-level transport errors. The
 * work-driver routes both flavours through its state machine; callers
 * should catch the rejection and emit a `dispatch-failed-provider`
 * (or similar) event into the state file.
