/**
 * plan-investigate — Phase 1b (duplicate risk) + Phase 2 (investigation
 * angles) of the compiled /plan pipeline, run as ONE parallel barrier.
 *
 * The duplicate-risk explore used to be a fully blocking serial dispatch
 * whose result the driver consumed only as a HIGH/not-HIGH boolean — a full
 * child process of wall clock added ahead of the angle fan-out for a check
 * that shares no data dependency with it. The structural cost audit
 * (outputs/spec-driven-plan-driver-gap.md §4) put the serial dispatch tax at
 * the centre of the operator's 20–30-minute-per-ticket report, so the two
 * phases now dispatch together and the HIGH-risk hard stop moves to AFTER
 * the barrier, before draft/gate/file. Semantics are unchanged — a HIGH
 * verdict still refuses to file — the only trade is that on HIGH the angle
 * tokens are already spent, and HIGH is the rare case.
 *
 * This module also owns the plan pipeline's dispatch bounds: every plan
 * child gets PLAN_DISPATCH_TIMEOUT_MS instead of riding the 2-hour spawn
 * backstop (a hung angle used to stall the whole ticket), plus `cwd` pinned
 * to the repo root (children used to inherit the parent process cwd — a
 * latent wrong-repo hazard for the gh/vipune searches they run).
