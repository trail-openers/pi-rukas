/**
 * oo-rewrite-guard — the silent rewrite of bare verbose-runner bash commands
 * to their `oo`-prefixed form for developer + ops subagents.
 *
 * The doctrine (agents-base/developer.md) makes the `oo` prefix mandatory for 12 verbose runners, but on the bash
 * tool's argument string that rule is pure prose: the only structural
 * enforcement layer (spawn.ts --exclude-tools / role-tools.ts) can remove
 * NAMED tools, not a bash-string distinction like `pytest` vs `oo pytest`.
 * Prose tool-preference is the least reliable enforcement mechanism in the
 * literature, so this hook enforces it deterministically: a bare 12-item
 * command at the START of the quote-stripped command string is rewritten
 * in-place to `oo <cmd>` in event.input.command, which Pi documents as
 * mutable — later tool_call handlers (the legacy subagent guard's verdict
 * handler) see the rewritten string, so in trust/sandbox mode a bare
 * `cargo test` routes through the existing `oo cargo test*` allow row
 * instead of relying on the model remembering the prefix.
 *
 * REWRITE ONLY — no block/deny path of any kind. This hook must NEVER return
 * `{ block: true }` for any input; a no-match is a pass-through, not a
 * refusal.
 *
 * Registration placement (mirrors registerDestructiveGitGuard /
 * registerIssueCreationGuard in permission-subagent-guard.ts): BEFORE the
 * sandbox-mode and trust-mode early returns, so the hook is registered in
 * every subagent process. The mode split is NOT achieved by placement — it
 * is an explicit guard clause in the hook body:
 *
 *   fire only when PI_ENSEMBLE_SANDBOX_MODE === "1" OR
 *   PI_ENSEMBLE_TRUST_MODE === "1".
 *
 * Why that exact gate (not a PI_ENSEMBLE_STRICT_PERMISSIONS check): spawn.ts
 * never sets PI_ENSEMBLE_STRICT_PERMISSIONS in the child env, and a strict-
 * parent child (PI_ENSEMBLE_SUBAGENT_MODE=1 + PI_ENSEMBLE_PERM_SOCKET, no
 * trust marker) is indistinguishable from a headless child inside the hook.
 * The gate above reads the SAME two primitives the legacy subagent guard's
 * own short-circuits read, so "legacy guard would short-circuit" (hook
 * fires) vs "legacy guard resolves verdicts" (hook inert) is a precise,
 * testable split — byte-identical behaviour in strict/headless children,
 * where the agents.json deny rows for bare pytest/cargo test/etc. are
 * reached exactly as today.
 *
 * Role-scoped: fires only when PI_ENSEMBLE_ROLE is exactly "developer" or
 * "ops" — the two roles whose doctrine prescribes mandatory oo. Read inside
 * the hook body (not at registration) so parent/PM and the other four
 * subagent roles stay untouched.
 *
 * Graceful degradation (operator's non-negotiable condition): not every
 * host has `oo` installed. The binary is probed ONCE at registration time
 * (injectable for tests); if absent, the hook is inert for the whole
 * session — a single debug-gated trace() line explains why, no per-call
 * re-probing, no per-call warning — and bare commands execute exactly as
 * today.
 *
 * Documented limitation (no mechanism, no test): with
 * PI_ENSEMBLE_DISABLE_EXTENSION_FORWARD=1 (spawn-extension-forward.ts) the
 * pi-rukas extension is not forwarded to subagent children at all, so this
 * hook simply never exists there — the harness continues working exactly as
 * it does today.
