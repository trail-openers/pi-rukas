/**
 * work-driver-handoff-recovery.md — the GitHub-body twin of
 * `recoveryCommandsChat` in work-driver-handoff-recovery.chat.ts (the
 * in-chat renderer). PURE PRESENTER over the shared decision in
 * work-driver-handoff-recovery.ts (`recoveryStepsForCap`): it renders the
 * shared steps' literal command lines VERBATIM (this surface is the one
 * they were written for — cwd-relative paths, `tmp/issue-<N>/` scratch,
 * the body is posted from the repo root), emits the cap-specific PROSE,
 * and falls back to the branch-name-predicate branches when the shared
 * recipe is empty. The WHICH-cap-yields-WHICH-step decision lives in the
 * shared module — one place, so the two surfaces cannot drift apart.
 *
 * Split out of work-driver-handoff-markdown.ts (AGENTS.md §12
 * file-size limit).
