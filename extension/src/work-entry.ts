/**
 * work-entry — starting a `/work` cycle, independent of who asked.
 *
 * Extracted from `commands.ts` so a tool can start a cycle the same way the
 * slash command does. The motivating incident: a PM hit a wall it could not get
 * past — it had killed a cycle over `needs-human-attention` labels and had no
 * way to restart one — so it reimplemented the driver by hand. No state file,
 * no queue, no handoff artifact, no review-cap timer, and a branch the driver
 * knew nothing about. Everything the compiled pipeline exists to guarantee was
 * silently absent, and nothing in the transcript said so.
 *
 * The fix is not more doctrine telling PM not to do that. It is giving PM the
 * real thing to call.
 *
 * What deliberately does NOT live here: `--merge`. It is one of two
 * `AuthoritySource`s and the only one that bypasses the #406/#407 policy judge.
 * An LLM-settable boolean there is a cycle granting itself merge authority, so
 * the tool has no such parameter and `launchWork` takes the grant as an
 * explicit argument that only the command path supplies.
