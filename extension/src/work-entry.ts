 * work-entry — starting a `/work` cycle, independent of who asked.

 * slash command does. A PM once hit a wall it could not get past (it had
 * killed a cycle over `needs-human-attention` labels and had no way to
 * restart one) and reimplemented the driver by hand — no state file, no
 * queue, no handoff artifact, no branch the driver knew about. The fix is
 * giving PM the real thing to call.
 *
 * `--merge` does NOT live here: it is the only `AuthoritySource` that bypasses
 * the #406/#407 policy judge; an LLM-settable boolean there is a cycle granting
