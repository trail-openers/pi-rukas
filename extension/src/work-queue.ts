/**
 * work-queue — the multi-issue `/work` queue and what happens when a group fails.
 *
 * Extracted from commands.ts (#368; also keeps that file under the 500-line
 * cap and gives #289's bounded pool somewhere to live).
 *
 * Pre-#368 the loop returned on any non-`merged` status, so one issue's
 * failure stopped every unrelated issue behind it. Observed on this machine:
 * `/work` over 13 issues died on #279 and left **11 groups unstarted**; a
 * three-issue batch halted on its second item while the third was unrelated
 * and independently ready. Since 69% of the failures that trigger this are
 * provider infrastructure (#366), the queue was usually being stopped by
 * something with no bearing on the remaining work.
 *
 * The replacement is dead-letter-queue semantics — three destinations, not
 * two — and the whole design rests on one question: *is the next group likely
 * to fail for the same reason?*
 *
 *   merged  → continue
 *   parked  → issue-scoped failure; record why, continue
 *   halted  → systemic; continuing would burn every remaining issue against
 *             the same wall (spend cap, quota window, driver throw)
