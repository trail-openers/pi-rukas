 *
 * - `Workstream` — the value type of `PipelineState.workstreams`, extended
 *   with `dependsOn?: string[]` (case 2(a)) and `integrationTest?: string`
 *   (case 3).
 * - `workstreamBaseShas` — the per-workstream effective base map (case 2(b)),
 *   declared here as a named type so the PipelineState field can reference
 *   it without inlining the long comment.
 *
 * Re-exported from workflow-state-schema.ts so existing importers keep their
 * paths unchanged.

 *   from a `- depends-on: <id>` line. Absent (or empty) means independent.
 *   Optional: state files written before #679 load unchanged.
 * - `integrationTest` — case 3. Path of the consolidated-tree test this
 *   workstream declares for the pair it depends on. A PLAN-QUALITY
 *   DECLARATION ONLY: the develop step does not execute it (that is #669's
 *   territory) — it exists so the plan gate can require integration
 *   coverage when two workstreams are interdependent through different
