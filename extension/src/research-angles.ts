/**
 * research-angles — tier→angle derivation and prompt framing for /research.

 * Judgement stays with PM: it may pass its own angle prompts (they are
 * framed and dispatched verbatim); when it does not, the default set is
 * DERIVED DETERMINISTICALLY from the tier and the topic (the codebase angle
 * runs only when the topic names code — the same codeIdentifiersIn signal
 * the plan driver uses). Width is deliberately bounded: the retrieval
 * literature shows hard diminishing returns past a handful of curated
 * sources (outputs/research-driver-landscape.md §2), so the fix for quality
 * is verification and artifacts, never more fan-out.
