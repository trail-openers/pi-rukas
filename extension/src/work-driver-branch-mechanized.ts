/**
 * work-driver-branch-mechanized — #287 Part A: branch setup as driver code.
 *
 * Pre-#287 the branch step narrated itself to an LLM ops subagent, which then
 * ran `git fetch/checkout/pull --ff-only` against repoRoot and, for N=1,
 * developed there directly (`worktrees = {default: repoRoot}`). That made
 * repoRoot a development tree, which is why:
 *
 *   - stale repoRoot residue was swept into a merged PR (incident #602);
 *   - an aborted step left a dirty tree that wedged every downstream issue's
 *     branch step;
 *   - parallel groups were impossible — two cycles would fight over one
 *     checkout.
 *
 * After #287 repoRoot is an INTEGRATION POINT ONLY. Nothing between branch and
 * commit-pr runs git against it. Every workstream — including the degenerate
 * N=1 `default` — gets `.worktrees/issue-<N>-<id>` detached at the resolved
 * base SHA, and patches are applied onto the feature branch at repoRoot by
 * `integrate()`.
 *
 * The branch itself is created lazily by `integrate()` via
 * `git checkout -B <branch> <baseSha>`; this step only resolves and records
 * the name, so a cycle that dies before producing a diff leaves no branch
 * behind.
 *
 * #844 — the branch name is resolved BEFORE any worktree exists, so a
 * stale local branch of the same name (a parked cycle's residue — the #830
 * incident) is inspected at the branch step, not at `integrate()`. A local
 * branch that does NOT contain the freshly-fetched `origin/<mainline>`
 * (behind, or diverged with everything already merged) is force-moved to
 * baseSha (`git branch -f`) and a `branch-reset` event records the old tip
 * so the work is recoverable. A branch that IS ahead of
 * `origin/<mainline>` (unpushed work — only a human can decide what to do
 * with it) halts the step via a `branch-ahead:branch` cap; nothing is
 * reset. The detection is purely read-only (two `git` probes) and runs
 * only against the resolved branch name, so a fresh cycle with no local
 * branch never sees it.
