/**
 * worktree — git worktree helpers for the always-worktree driver (#287).
 *
 * Rewritten from the P1 stub, which had no importers: it shelled out with
 * `execFile` in `process.cwd()`, always created a `scratch/<name>` branch, and
 * returned a relative path. All three are wrong for the driver, which operates
 * on an absolute repoRoot, wants worktrees DETACHED at a base SHA (a scratch
 * branch per workstream is a second thing to clean up and a second way to
 * confuse `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`), and needs absolute paths to hand
 * to subagents as their cwd.
 *
 * Every call takes the driver's `ExecFn` so the same injection seam the verify
 * gates use covers worktree setup too — #287's acceptance criterion is a test
 * that records (command, cwd) pairs and asserts no git command runs with
 * `cwd === repoRoot` between branch and commit-pr, which is only observable if
 * these calls go through that seam.
