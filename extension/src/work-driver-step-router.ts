 * the per-child failures several events back. Reading only the last event

 *
 * Measured consequence: three developers hit a 429 carrying a 59-second
 * retry-after — a delay the taxonomy already knows how to wait out, and does
 * wait out for single dispatches — and the step halted with
 * `transientRetryAttempts: {}`. Never attempted, not exhausted. A transient
 * throttle and "the developer genuinely failed" collapsed into the same
 * `ok:false`, and the cap tripped on the latter's semantics.
 *
 * The scan is bounded by `branches-fanned-out`, the marker that opens the
 * fan-out, so it can never reach back into a previous step. All children must
 * have failed for this to return a failure: if any workstream succeeded, the
 * step's problem is not purely transient and re-running it is not the answer.
