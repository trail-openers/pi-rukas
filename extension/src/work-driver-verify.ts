 * PR14 + #540 — Verify the integration branch's committed diff (vs

 * safety gate in runCommitPr.
 *
 * Coverage rule (#540): a workstream W is COVERED iff for EVERY declared
 * path p of W: p is in the committed diff, OR p is declared by a sibling S
 * whose ENTIRE declared path set is present in the committed diff
 * (full-set subsumption). A partial sibling cannot cover another
 * workstream's path — with A={a,b}, B={b} and commit={b} only, B is
 * covered (its own full set is present) but A is NOT: b is present, but a
 * is absent and B's full set {b} does not cover a. The pre-#540 rule
 * (`any path present`) fired in the mirror case (commit={a,b}) where B's
 * path "b" WAS in the diff but flagged B's overlap pessimism, and missed
 * the false-pass direction entirely.
 *
 * Returns BOTH sides of the verdict: `missing` (workstreams not covered,
 * for backward compat with the PR14 cap-hit message) AND `filesPresent`
 * (the committed file list — what actually shipped, so the handoff can
 * render present + missing).
 *
 * Best-effort: any git-shell failure returns no-missing (don't false-
 * alarm on a transient git issue). The N=1 case short-circuits since
 * there's only one workstream and partial-commit doesn't apply.

 * anything until post-PR CI. Agents claim "done" and the driver trusted
 * the claim — the documented silent-merge (#245/#253) and phantom-
 * handoff incidents are exactly this failure class (MAST: verification
 * failures = 21.3% of multi-agent failures). This gate checks executed
 * evidence, costs zero LLM tokens, and shortens the failure loop from
 * post-PR CI churn to pre-commit.
 *
 * Checks by step:
 *
 *   develop — delegated to verifyDevelopOutcome in work-driver-verify-develop.ts.
 *
 *   commit-pr —
 *     (a) commits exist on the branch: `git rev-list --count
 *         origin/<base>..<branchName>` > 0 at repoRoot (#451 — the branch
 *         is named explicitly so the gate works regardless of repo-root checkout).
 *     (b) the parsed PR number resolves via the forge adapter. When ops
 *         forgot the `pr: <N>` marker, fall back to a head-branch PR
 *         list and ADOPT the number into pipelineState
 *         (bonus repair — pre-PR17 a missing marker degraded handoff
 *         targeting). No PR found at all = the "opened a PR" claim was
 *         hollow.
 *
 * Failure semantics: returns `{ok: false, failures}` — the caller emits
 * cap-hit `verify-failed:<step>` → handoff with evidence in
 * pipelineState.verifyEvidence. Infra errors on OUR side (git itself
 * erroring at repoRoot) are notes, not failures — same no-false-alarm
 * stance as verifyConsolidation.
