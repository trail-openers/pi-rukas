/**
 * work-driver-dep-scheduler — #679 case 2(a)/2(b): topological dispatch order
 * and deferred worktree creation for workstreams that declare `depends-on`.
 *
 * The plan-quality gate (planQualityReason) guarantees the depends-on graph
 * is a DAG — no cycles, no dangling references — BEFORE runDevelop runs.
 * This module therefore needs no cycle handling of its own; it only resolves
 * the full transitive closure of `dependsOn` so that a dependent workstream
 * is dispatched only AFTER its entire dependency chain has committed.
 *
 * Independent workstreams (no `dependsOn`) are dispatched in parallel as
 * before (`Promise.all` over the independent set). Dependent workstreams are
 * dispatched sequentially after their dependencies complete, in topological
 * order (A → B → C for a 3-deep chain). A workstream whose dependency
 * FAILED (dispatch threw, or the dependency's worktree has zero commits
 * ahead of its own base) is SKIPPED — recorded as `branch-completed` with
 * `ok: false` and a reason — because building on an empty or failed
 * dependency would produce an incoherent tree. There is no baseSha fallback:
 * a fallback to baseSha is exactly what produces the "dependent workstream
 * sees none of the dependency's work" failure the ticket fixes.
 *
 * The N=1 `default` path and plans with no `dependsOn` declarations are
 * byte-identical to the pre-#679 behaviour: every workstream is independent,
 * the independent set is all of them, and `Promise.all` runs as before.

 * (this workstream set, created by the branch step or by an earlier
 * dependent). The #545 same-issue dirty scan is unbounded within a cycle:
 * without this exclusion, an EARLIER workstream's legitimate in-progress
 * dirt (its developer still working) would be misread as a "leftover" and
 * park the cycle on a false positive. In-cycle paths are therefore excluded
 * from the scan; a genuinely foreign leftover is still caught.

 *   - "dirty-leftover" — a pre-add guard (DirtyWorktreeError) refused BEFORE
 *     `git worktree add` ran. There is no git command to record for this
 *     class; the error text IS the finding (it names the leftover path).
 *     The caller PARKS the cycle on this class.
 *   - "create-error" — the creation itself failed (the add, or a guard that
 *     surfaced as a plain error). `gitCommand` / `exitStatus` / `stderr` are
 *     filled in when they are known (the add threw), else the error text
 *     carries the detail via `gitErrorDetail`.
 *
 * The return shape mirrors the `DeferredCreationEventFragment`/
 * `DeferredCreationFailure` record the caller writes onto the
 * `branch-completed` event (minus the deferral context) — keep the two in
 * sync.
