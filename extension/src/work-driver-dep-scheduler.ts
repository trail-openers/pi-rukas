/**
 * work-driver-dep-scheduler — #679 case 2(a)/2(b): topological dispatch order
 * and deferred worktree creation for workstreams that declare `depends-on`.
 *
 * The plan-quality gate (planQualityReason) guarantees the depends-on graph
 * is a DAG — no cycles, no dangling references — BEFORE runDevelop runs.
 * This module therefore needs no cycle handling of its own; it only resolves
 * the full transitive closure of `dependsOn` so that a dependent workstream
 * is dispatched only AFTER its entire dependency chain has committed.
 *
 * Independent workstreams (no `dependsOn`) are dispatched in parallel as
 * before (`Promise.all` over the independent set). Dependent workstreams are
 * dispatched sequentially after their dependencies complete, in topological
 * order (A → B → C for a 3-deep chain). A workstream whose dependency
 * FAILED (dispatch threw, or the dependency's worktree has zero commits
 * ahead of its own base) is SKIPPED — recorded as `branch-completed` with
 * `ok: false` and a reason — because building on an empty or failed
 * dependency would produce an incoherent tree. There is no baseSha fallback:
 * a fallback to baseSha is exactly what produces the "dependent workstream
 * sees none of the dependency's work" failure the ticket fixes.
 *
 * The N=1 `default` path and plans with no `dependsOn` declarations are
 * byte-identical to the pre-#679 behaviour: every workstream is independent,
 * the independent set is all of them, and `Promise.all` runs as before.

 *   topological order: a workstream appears only AFTER all of its
 *   dependencies (direct and transitive) have appeared earlier in the list.

 * wait on B, which is the full closure, not just the direct edge.
