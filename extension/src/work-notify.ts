/**
 * work-notify — the one place `/work` reaches a human who has walked away.
 *
 * `/work <issues>` is meant to be fire-and-forget, but when a cycle parked,
 * halted, or stopped awaiting a human merge, the only places that said so
 * were the Pi scrollback and a JSON file — both of which require you to
 * already be looking. `grep -rniE 'osascript|terminal-notifier|notify-send|
 * webhook|slack'` over `src/` returned nothing. The realistic sequence was:
 * fire over eight issues, go to lunch, come back two hours later to find it
 * stopped after twenty minutes on the second group.
 *
 * Three deliberate constraints:
 *
 *   1. **The transport is not our business.** The operator supplies a command
 *      (`PI_ENSEMBLE_NOTIFY_CMD`) and we run it — `osascript`,
 *      `terminal-notifier`, `notify-send`, `curl` to a webhook, `say`. Picking
 *      one for them means picking wrong for most of them.
 *   2. **Fail open, always.** A notification is an observer, and an observer
 *      that can break the thing it observes is worse than none. Every failure
 *      mode — missing binary, non-zero exit, a hook that hangs — is swallowed
 *      after a short timeout and recorded only in the trace.
 *   3. **Name the action, not the event.** "Issue #287 parked" is not
 *      actionable. "add acceptance criteria to #287" is. The queue already
 *      computes this in `humanActionFor`; the hook carries it rather than
 *      inventing its own wording.
 *
 * The message is passed on **stdin**, not interpolated into a shell line.
 * Issue titles and provider error text are untrusted input, and building a
 * command string out of them would be a shell-injection seam in a component
 * whose entire job is to be harmless.
