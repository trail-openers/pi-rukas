/**
 * plan-gaps — Phase-4 gap-gate parsing and cap routing for the compiled
 * /plan pipeline.
 *
 * Split out of plan-driver.ts at the same seam as forge-ci.ts / plan-draft.ts
 * (the 500-line hard limit, AGENTS.md §12). Owns:
 *
 *   - the GAP_RESOLUTION_PLACEHOLDER sentinel, exported for plan-writeback.ts
 *     to key branch-3 detection on the EXACT string parseGaps assigns (the
 *     edge-case pitfall: re-spelling the literal would silently flip the
 *     branch when the parser's placeholder changes),
 *   - `parseGaps`: the reviewer-reply parser (GAP: markers, UNGROUNDED:
 *     third-outcome lines since #638, the verdict line, and — since this split —
 *     a `verdictParsed` flag that keeps an ABSENT verdict from silently
 *     passing as READY when CRITICAL gaps are present (D3)).
 *   - the iteration cap: `evaluateGapGate` decides READY / one corrective
 *     round / cap-hit, and `capRouted` applies the routing policy — the
 *     TERMINAL RULE is CRITICAL-only (direct precedent: /work's adversarial
 *     gate #664, where the measured 83.7% of rejections sat on a verdict
 *     the doctrine called non-blocking, and the fix was a policy terminal
 *     rule, not a findings filter): at the cap, zero CRITICAL gaps FILE
 *     the spec with the residual HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW gaps disclosed in a
 *     "## Residual gap-gate findings" section (D2); CRITICAL remains → do
 *     not file, surface to the operator. With CRITICAL-only blocking, a
 *     ratcheting stream of fresh HIGH findings is structurally incapable of
 *     preventing filing — the findings travel, they are not deduped. The
 *     corrective round likewise fires only on CRITICAL: HIGH no longer
 *     triggers re-drafting, because the gate is non-deterministic on
 *     identical input and "fix the gaps and re-run" is not a convergent
 *     strategy.
