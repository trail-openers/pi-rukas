/**
 * plan-driver — the compiled five-phase /plan pipeline (orchestrator).
 *
 * A compiled driver PM calls, not a prose flow PM re-implements. The
 * mode-independent issue-creation guard (issue-creation-guard.ts) makes
 * the replacement safe: direct `gh issue create` bash is refused for
 * every role in every mode.
 *
 * Phase compilation (each phase's detail lives in its module's header):
 *   0  Classify [plan-types.ts] · 0b Precheck [plan-precheck.ts]
 *   1  Inventory — vipune + `gh issue list`, driver-run [plan-draft.ts]
 *   1b+2 Investigate — duplicate-risk + angles as ONE parallel barrier
 *      [plan-investigate.ts] — includes the #677 NEVER CLAIM post-filter
 *   3  Draft [plan-draft.ts] · 3b Validate [plan-validate.ts]
 *   4  Gap gate — CRITICAL-only terminal rule [plan-gaps.ts]
 *   5  File — forge issueCreate [plan-filing.ts]
 *
 * dryRun is the confirmation seam: `dryRun: true` returns the spec +
 * gaps without filing; on confirmation the driver is re-called without
 * dryRun. Every phase is timed (PlanResult.timings — measure, then cut).
