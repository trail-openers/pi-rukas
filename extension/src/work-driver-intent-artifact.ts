/**
 * work-driver-intent-artifact — restore the intent verdict from the
 * persisted spec artifact when the prose reply does not say it.
 *
 * The DRIVER persists the resolved spec to `.pi/work-state/<issue>/spec.txt`
 * (the same channel the issue-body artifacts use) after reconciliation in
 * `runExplore` — the resolver's prose reply is the primary record, and the
 * file is the durable shadow of the decision. On a SUBSEQUENT cycle, when
 * the prose does not parse — or parses only to the parser's synthetic
 * default park — the artifact is the surviving record of a valid decision,
 * and discarding it parks solid issues that the resolver fully resolved
 * (#594). It is a recovery channel, not a new decision.
 *
 * Two invariants bound how far the artifact may go:
 *
 *   1. An EXPLICIT prose park always wins over an artifact `proceed`. The
 *      resolver chose to stop; the file it also wrote cannot talk it back
 *      into building. (The same shape as #404: a park nobody declared may
 *      be refuted, a park that was declared may not.)
 *   2. The artifact must validate EVERY element, not just the top-level
 *      shape. A cast of the form `value as unknown as NormalisedSpec`
 *      (PR #597's version) trusts the resolver's JSON structure, and a
 *      half-written or truncated artifact with null elements would flow
 *      into `specIsComplete` / `renderAssumptions` and crash the driver.
 *      `parseNormalisedSpecArtifact` returns `undefined` on any malformed
 *      element instead.
 *
 * The artifact-path helpers (`exploreSpecArtifactPath`, `readSpecArtifact`,
 * `deleteSpecArtifact`, `persistSpecArtifact`) and the merge decision
 * (`resolveIntentVerdict`) live here too, so `runExplore` stays a thin
 * "delete stale → parse prose → reconcile → read artifact → merge" and
 * the 500-line limit in `work-driver-explore.ts` holds without a refactor.
