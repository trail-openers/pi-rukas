/**
 * Per-role tool exclude lists for SPAWNED SUBAGENTS (PR #238 — Option A in
 * plan indexed-swimming-lovelace.md).
 *
 * Background: trust-mode (#215) stripped per-call permission gating, leaving
 * doctrine alone to keep agents in their roles. Under load, doctrine grip
 * slips. Research (Flue + LangGraph + MAST) names per-role tool gating at
 * the dispatch boundary as the primary structural lever — Flue's
 * `defineAgentProfile({ tools })` filters the model's toolbox so it cannot
 * call what it wasn't given, regardless of what the prompt says.
 *
 * Scope: this file gates **spawned subagents** (developer, ops, explore,
 * adversarial-developer, code-review-specialist). The parent Pi session
 * (which acts as PM when invoked via a /work slash command, but also acts
 * as a generic developer when the user iterates on pi-rukas itself) is
 * NOT gated here — its containment is via doctrine + the user's own
 * supervision, and structural per-step gating arrives with Option D
 * (checkpointed /work). Adding `--exclude-tools` to the parent would break
 * meta-work like "edit project-manager.md".
 *
 * Why exclude-list, not allow-list: Pi keeps adding tools (ctx7,
 * mcp__codebase_memory__*, dispatch_*). An exhaustive per-role allow-list would
 * drift the moment Pi or pi-rukas adds a tool. Exclude-list only names
 * what we KNOW should not be on a role — much more stable.
 *
 * What we exclude per role:
 *
 *  - adversarial-developer: write, edit, multiedit. This role is a
 *    skeptical READER; it must not modify the diff under review (silent
 *    edit + approve is a catastrophic regression that doctrine alone
 *    historically failed to prevent).
 *
 *  - code-review-specialist: write, edit, multiedit. Same reasoning —
 *    reviewer must not be able to mutate the code it reviews. agents.json
 *    has `write: deny` + `edit: deny` already; this is the structural
 *    backstop now that those are doctrine-only post-#215.
 *
 *  - explore: write, edit, multiedit. Explore is a researcher; the role
 *    prompt forbids file modifications, and now the runtime does too.
 *
 *  - developer, ops: empty exclude list. These roles legitimately need
 *    write/edit/bash to do their jobs. Tool-gating doesn't help here
 *    (developer SHOULD edit); their containment lives at the workflow
 *    layer (Option D — checkpointed /work, tracked in #237).
 *
 *  - project-manager (rarely spawned — usually the parent process, not a
 *    subagent): empty. If a future flow spawns PM as a subagent it inherits
 *    the same trust assumptions as the parent.
