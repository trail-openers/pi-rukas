/**
 * plan-tool — the compiled `start_plan_driver` tool.
 *
 * `/plan` used to be a 473-line prose body sent into PM's context, which PM
 * then executed by hand — with a self-judged "triviality test" and no gate
 * between that self-judgment and `gh issue create`. The fix follows the
 * `start_work_driver` precedent (work-tool.ts): a compiled driver PM calls
 * instead of a prose flow PM re-implements, plus the mode-independent
 * issue-creation guard (issue-creation-guard.ts) that makes the replacement
 * safe by closing every other door.
 *
 * The driver (plan-driver.ts) runs the five-phase pipeline:
 *
 *   Phase 0  Classify   regex on the descriptor (or the `type` param)
 *   Phase 1  Inventory  vipune + `gh issue list` run by the driver; one
 *                       explore dispatch for duplicate risk
 *   Phase 2  Investigate type-specialised explore angles in parallel
 *   Phase 3  Draft      the driver assembles the structured body
 *   Phase 4  Gap gate   one adversarial-developer dispatch; CRITICAL gets
 *                       one corrective pass (CRITICAL-only terminal rule,
 *                       #664 transposed — HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW never re-draft),
 *                       then the residual findings travel with the spec
 *   Phase 5  File       `gh issue create --body-file` via execp
 *
 * **dryRun is the confirmation seam.** `dryRun: true` returns
 * `{ spec, gaps, priorContext, filed: false }` without filing; PM shows the
 * spec + gap disposition to the operator; on confirmation the driver is
 * re-called with `dryRun` omitted and files. Non-resumable by design (a
 * 2-5 minute flow; re-running is cheaper than a state file).
 *
 * The driver's own filing is a child-process exec — exempt from the
 * tool_call guard by construction, exactly like the work driver's
 * mechanized `gh pr create`.
