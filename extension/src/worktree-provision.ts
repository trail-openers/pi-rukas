/**
 * worktree-provision — make a fresh worktree usable, not just present.
 *
 * `git worktree add --detach` gives you tracked files and nothing else. Every
 * gitignored directory a project's toolchain depends on — `node_modules`, a
 * virtualenv, a vendor tree — is absent, and the develop step then runs the
 * project's verify command inside that tree.
 *
 * How badly this bites is language-dependent, which is why it went unnoticed:
 *
 *   - Rust: `cargo check` rebuilds from scratch. It works. It costs minutes,
 *     per worktree, per cycle.
 *   - Node/bun: the command fails outright. pi-rukas's own verify command
 *     needs `extension/node_modules`, which is gitignored — so pi-rukas
 *     dogfooding `/work` on itself could not pass its own develop gate until
 *     #481 made discovery look below `repoRoot`.
 *
 * Two mechanisms, in order:
 *
 *   1. `.pi/worktree-setup` — the project says what it needs. No guessing, and
 *      anything the allowlist below cannot express goes here. The hook
 *      receives no arguments and no environment and runs with cwd = the new
 *      worktree; locating `repoRoot` is the hook's own job (e.g. `git
 *      rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir`). The hook path
 *      skips the symlink loop — including the `info/exclude` write — so a
 *      hook that creates a symlink must write its own exclude entry or
 *      `stagePorcelainPaths` will stage the link into the PR.
 *   2. Otherwise, symlink a small allowlist of dependency directories that
 *      are gitignored and non-empty, discovered by scanning one level of
 *      package directories for manifests/lockfiles (`extension/`, `pkg/`,
 *      …) as well as `repoRoot` itself. #481: the scan is what lets a
 *      nested-package monorepo — pi-rukas itself — provision without a
 *      per-clone hook, and it is what stops an EMPTY `node_modules/` at
 *      `repoRoot` from being linked and reported as a useful link.
 *
 * The allowlist is deliberately short and deliberately excludes build output.
 * `node_modules` is read-mostly and safe for N worktrees to share. `target/`,
 * `build/` and `dist/` are write-heavy: sharing one across a fan-out would
 * serialise the parallel workstreams that always-worktree (#287) exists to
 * enable, turning a correctness fix into a throughput regression.
 *
 * Provisioning never fails the branch step. A worktree without dependencies is
 * exactly what shipped before this module, so the failure mode of "could not
 * link" is the status quo, not a regression — it is traced and reported, and
 * the cycle continues.

 *
 *   - exit 0 → IGNORED: linkable.

 *     run against a path outside any repo) read as "not ignored" and a
 *     tracked directory was silently treated as a linkable candidate.
 *
 * The seam is preserved: the probe goes through the injected `execFn`, so
 * tests can fake the three states by rejecting with different `code`
 * values. The production `execFn` is `promisify(exec)`, whose rejection
 * carries `.code: <exit status>` on a non-zero exit, so the discrimination
 * is free — the error object is already there, we just inspect it. A
 * rejection with no numeric `.code` (exec itself failed to spawn) is
 * treated as `git-error` (same as ≥2), so a candidate we cannot confirm as
