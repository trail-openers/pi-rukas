/**
 * reply-markers — reading a `TOKEN: value` marker out of a subagent's reply.
 *
 * Every step in this driver asks a child to end with a structured marker, and
 * every step grew its own matcher for it. They drifted, and each drifted into
 * the same defect: **a marker that fails to parse produces a confident wrong
 * answer rather than an obvious failure.**
 *
 *   - `parseVerdict` (adversarial) was case-sensitive with no bold tolerance,
 *     so `**VERDICT: APPROVED**` fell through to `ISSUES_FOUND` — and handed
 *     the fix-developer the entire approval message as its list of findings.
 *   - the `ci` step used a bare `text.includes("ci-status: success")`, so any
 *     emphasis or capitalisation drift silently became a CI failure, burning
 *     the retry budget and parking a green cycle.
 *   - `PARK-REASON` was colon-anchored, so a resolver writing it as a heading
 *     got the synthesised default `underspecified` instead — which #397's
 *     override then read as a diagnosis and used to license building the
 *     wrong thing (#404).
 *
 * One reader, shared, tolerant of the shapes agents actually emit — and, just
 * as importantly, able to say **"absent"** distinctly from **"parsed as X"**.
 * The callers are what decide whether absence is safe; they cannot decide it
 * if the parser has already collapsed the two.
