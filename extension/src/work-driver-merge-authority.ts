/**
 * work-driver-merge-authority — may this cycle merge, and is it safe to?
 *
 * Merging is the one irreversible act in the cycle and was the least guarded.
 * Before this module:
 *
 *   - **No authority gate existed at all.** `grep -rniE "merge.?polic|allowed
 *     to merge|automerge|canMerge"` over `src/` returned nothing. The driver
 *     merged whenever the cycle reached the `merged` step, so auto-merge was
 *     effectively default-ON.
 *   - **Merging was decided by a substring in an LLM's reply** —
 *     `text.includes("ci-status: success")`. The driver never called
 *     `gh pr checks`, never read `mergeStateStatus`, never checked reviews.
 *
 * Two independent things have to be true now, and both default to "no":
 *
 *   1. **Authority** — someone explicitly permitted merging. Either the
 *      project's own documents say so, or the operator granted it for the run.
 *      Absent a grant the PR is opened and the cycle parks; a repo that never
 *      opted in never gets an auto-merge. Since #407 the documents are read by
 *      a judge child and its answer is citation-verified, rather than matched
 *      against three English regexes that got real files wrong in both
 *      directions — see `work-driver-policy.ts`.
 *   2. **Evidence** — required checks actually passed, per `gh`, not per an
 *      agent's narration.
 *
 * No vendor auto-merges agent PRs today (Copilot's docs require a second
 * reviewer and explicitly do not count the agent's own approval), so there is
 * no gate-set to copy. This one is constructed, and deliberately conservative
 * in both directions.
