/**
 * Companion Pi extension loaded into each /plan Phase-2 investigation child.
 *
 * Registers a single `report_plan_item` tool with a TypeBox-validated schema.
 * Each angle specialist calls this tool ONCE per structured item it
 * identifies (an acceptance criterion, a test-surface entry, an edge case,
 * a sub-issue, a reference, an out-of-scope boundary); Pi validates the
 * params in-process and the parent (plan-draft.ts) extracts every call from
 * the child's `tool_use` events.
 *
 * The reason this is a tool call rather than a prose list is the fix for the
 * plan driver's line-splitting defect: `extractLines()` parsed the child's
 * prose reply line-by-line, so "Task complete:" preambles, `##` headings and
 * `**` debris all leaked into typed fields like Acceptance criteria. With a
 * schema-validated tool call there is no text to parse — the shape is
 * enforced by Pi inside the child, exactly like `report_finding` (lens
 * review) and `report_policy` (#407).
 *
 * No execution logic: the tool exists so the model has a structured way to
 * emit items. Acknowledging the call is enough — the parent reads the
 * `tool_use` blocks afterward.
 *
 * Loaded via `pi --no-extensions --extension <path-to-this-file>` from
 * plan-driver.ts; never auto-discovered.

/**
 * #638 deliverable 3 (task-b): the ONE definition of the `reference` kind,
 * reused by BOTH definitional copies — this TypeBox schema (loaded into each
 * angle child as the report_plan_item tool description) and PLAN_REPORTER_PROMPT
 * (plan-angles.ts, appended to every angle task text). One shared constant
 * instead of two hand-written strings means the two copies cannot drift
 * apart (the #664 lesson: two copies of one definition in the same composed
 * prompt contradict each other — so there is exactly one definition).
 *
 * The grounding constraint is the anti-fabrication fix: on an empty repo the
 * old definition ("a file or pattern that already exists") admitted no honest
 * value, which is what made the model invent paths. Absence is now a
 * legitimate, reportable item — one honest line, never a fabricated path.
