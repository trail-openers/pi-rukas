/**
 * check — deterministic staleness and corruption checks for AGENTS.md.
 *
 * No LLM, no judgment. Each check is a boolean the shell or the filesystem can
 * answer on its own, and the process exit code encodes the outcome the design
 * fixes:
 *
 *   0  clean — markers valid, nothing referenced is missing
 *   1  findings / drift — the file parses and is well-formed, but a referenced
 *       path no longer exists, a gate command's tool is not on PATH, or a
 *       ledger row drifted from its auto-derivation
 *   2  refuse / corrupt / invalid — the markers cannot be parsed, a managed
 *       section is empty, or the file is otherwise in a state we refuse to act
 *       on
 *   3  gated on a human — a check requires interactive confirmation (e.g. a
 *       headless `ask`), which this process cannot grant
 *
 * The cheap checks (path existence, `command -v`, `bash -n`) run by default.
 * `--deep` additionally *executes* the gate commands to prove they pass, which
 * is opt-in because running a project's test suite is not a free side effect a
 * `check` should have by default.
