/**
 * work-driver-handoff-recovery.chat — the in-chat twin of
 * `recoveryCommandsMarkdown` in work-driver-handoff-recovery.md.ts
 * (the GitHub-body renderer). PURE PRESENTER over the shared decision in
 * work-driver-handoff-recovery.ts (`recoveryStepsForCap`): it re-qualifies
 * the shared literal lines to absolute paths (`git -C <repoRoot>`,
 * absolute scratch), emits the cap-specific PROSE, and falls back to the
 * branch-name-predicate branches when the shared recipe is empty. The
 * WHICH-cap-yields-WHICH-step decision lives in the shared module — one
 * place, so the two surfaces cannot drift apart.
 *
 * Split out of work-driver-handoff-message.ts (AGENTS.md §12
 * file-size limit).
