 * restoreCheckout (injected at call site).

 * them raw — JSON.stringify for quoting or prefer execFile-style arrays.

/**
 * Restore the local checkout to an up-to-date mainline after a merge.

 * Order (load-bearing):
 *   1. `git fetch origin --prune` — update remote tracking refs.
 *   2. `git checkout <mainline>` — switch to mainline.
 *   3. `git pull --ff-only origin <mainline>` — fast-forward.
 *   4. `git branch -d <mergedBranch>` — delete merged feature branch.
 *
 * Every step is idempotent: already on mainline, branch already deleted,
 * and already-up-to-date are all tolerated without error.
 *
 * `git branch -d` (lowercase) is used deliberately — on a squash-merged
 * branch the SHAs differ and -d refuses. This is expected; we report
 * but do NOT escalate to `-D` (the PR body says the branch is gone, and
 * force-deleting locally would hide that the refusal is the normal
 * outcome). The leftover is removed later, by hand: `git branch -D
 * <mergedBranch>`. An automated sweep is out of scope for this function
 * because a naive `[gone]`/`--merged` sweep would also delete local
 * branches that have no upstream at all.
 *
 * Returns an array of notes (informational messages, not errors).
 * Every step is individually caught: a fetch failure, a checkout failure,
 * a `--ff-only` refusal, and a `branch -d` refusal all become notes,
 * never exceptions. The only path that propagates is an unexpected throw
 * from the caller-provided execFn itself (e.g. an exec option rejection).
