/**
 * work-driver-lens-cap — what the review cap records, where it routes, and
 * what it discloses on the way.
 *
 * `nextStep` is a pure function of state and cannot write, so it routes a
 * cap-hit by reading the event itself (`lastEvent.nextStep`). That makes this
 * module the only place a capped review's destination is decided.
 *
 * **The round cap used to park work that was merge-worthy.** Measured: two of
 * six outcomes in one overnight run died at
 * `lens-issues-found → cap-hit{round-cap} → handoff`. A human then judged #457
 * merge-as-is, and #680's PR merged unchanged. Each park cost a re-run plus
 * operator time, for a diff that was already fine.
 *
 * So a round cap now routes to `ci` when the review's verdict is
 * `ISSUES_FOUND`. Three conditions keep that from being a rubber stamp:
 *
 *  - `CRITICAL_ISSUES_FOUND` still parks. A critical finding is the case the
 *    cap exists for, and no amount of "the human agreed last time" applies.
 *  - The **wall-clock** cap still parks. A review that ran out of time is a
 *    different signal from one that ran out of rounds: it says nothing about
 *    how small the remaining findings are, only that the loop was slow.
 *  - The residual findings are posted to the PR **first**, and a disclosure
 *    that fails parks. A PR that silently swallows three rounds of unresolved
 *    findings is worse than a park, so the disclosure is the condition for
 *    routing on, not a courtesy alongside it.
 *
 * Routing to `ci` does not merge anything. The cycle still passes the CI gate
 * and then `runMerged`'s merge-authority gate, which is default-deny and needs
 * an operator grant plus executed `gh` evidence; without a grant it parks as
 * `awaiting-human-merge` with the PR open. This module changes where a capped
 * cycle goes, never what it is permitted to do when it gets there.
