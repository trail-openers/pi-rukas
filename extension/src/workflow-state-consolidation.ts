/**
 * #540 — the subsumption-aware consolidation verdict of a single workstream
 * from `verifyConsolidation` (work-driver-verify.ts). A workstream is
 * `complete` when EVERY declared path is in the committed diff OR is
 * declared by a sibling whose ENTIRE declared path set is present (full-set
 * subsumption — a partial sibling cannot cover another workstream's path).
 * `uncovered` is the same, with `uncoveredPaths` naming exactly which
 * declared paths the rule could not cover. `unverifiable` is the honest
 * third state: no declared paths (the planner gave nothing to verify) or the
 * diff read itself failed (best-effort — a transient git issue must not
 * false-alarm the whole cycle).
 *
 * #875 — the `uncovered` member carries a per-workstream `dirty` flag,
 * computed ONCE at gate time from the worktree's `git status --porcelain`
 * (modified + untracked). The handoff renderers read ONLY this persisted
 * field — never a live git call — and claim "uncommitted on disk" only
 * for workstreams with `dirty: true`. Absent on state files written before
 * #875 (and on `complete`/`moved`/`unverifiable`); readers must tolerate
 * the absence (legacy verdicts render with the pre-#875 unconditional
 * wording via the reader adapters' `?? true` default).
