/**
 * work-driver-resume — survive the Pi process dying mid-cycle.
 *
 * `/work` is meant to be something you fire and walk away from, and until
 * #382 a crash in the middle of it lost the cycle *and* left the state file
 * asserting otherwise. The resume machinery was declared but inert:
 *
 *   - `resumable: false` was a literal in the TYPE, so it could never be
 *     anything else.
 *   - `inFlightJobIds` was declared, validated and rendered — and never
 *     written anywhere in `src/`.
 *   - `dispatch-started` was never emitted at all, so the validator that
 *     cross-checks in-flight ids against it could only ever pass vacuously.
 *   - State was persisted only at step boundaries, while a single dispatch
 *     can run for thirty minutes. A crash inside that window left the file
 *     at the *previous* boundary, still saying `status: "running"`.
 *
 * The result was that a crashed cycle looked exactly like a running one
 * forever, and the only documented escape — `--restart` — wipes the state
 * file but not GitHub, so it either rebuilt already-committed work or halted
 * on the #362 pre-flight.
 *
 * Two mechanisms here:
 *
 *   1. **Write-ahead.** `markDispatchStarted` persists the intent to dispatch
 *      BEFORE the await, so a crash is recorded rather than invisible.
 *   2. **Ownership.** A state file that says `running` is either a live
 *      driver's or a corpse's, and those need opposite responses. The owner
 *      record distinguishes them: resuming a live cycle would run two drivers
 *      against one branch, which is worse than refusing.
 *
 * Resume granularity is the STEP, not the dispatch — the child process is
 * gone and its work with it. That is sound because every step is
 * dispatch-then-verify and the verify gates catch partial work; `branch`
 * carries the issue-level PR pre-flight (#362, runBranch), `commit-pr` an
 * exact-branch re-entry guard (findOpenPrForBranch — a prior push+prCreate
 * short-circuits instead of duplicating), and `merged` already-merged
 * tolerance.
