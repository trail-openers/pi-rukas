/**
 * work-driver-attention — read the signal the driver has only ever written.
 *
 * When a cycle hits the review cap it hands off: posts an artifact, and labels
 * the issue `needs-human-attention`. Ten references to that label exist and all
 * ten write it. Nothing has ever read it back.
 *
 * So `/work N` on an issue a previous cycle gave up on quietly starts the whole
 * pipeline again — same issue body, same cap, same handoff — and the human the
 * label was addressed to is never consulted. In the incident that motivated
 * this, a PM noticed by hand, killed the cycle, could not restart it, and
 * reimplemented the driver by hand: no state file, no queue, no handoff, no
 * review-cap timer, and a branch the driver knew nothing about.
 *
 * `--restart` is the override, and it is the right one: it already means "I
 * have revised the issue, start clean", which is exactly what a human resolving
 * the flag would do.
