/**
 * work-driver-intent — turn ANY issue body into a normalised spec, then decide.
 *
 * `/work` used to assume an issue tells it what to build. Real backlogs do not
 * honour that: issues are hand-written, terse, imported from another project,
 * or simply wrong. Measured externally, 38.3% of real GitHub issues are
 * underspecified (SWE-bench Verified, 93 annotators over 1,699 samples), and
 * 41.77% of multi-agent failures are specification and system design (MAST) —
 * the largest single category.
 *
 * Two structural problems this replaces:
 *
 *   1. A missing verdict meant "build it" (`work-driver-plan.ts` defaulted an
 *      absent token to NEEDS_WORK). Silence was treated as permission.
 *   2. Nothing asked whether the issue was TRUE — whether the named symbols
 *      exist, whether the described behaviour matches the code, whether the
 *      work is already done. A confidently-wrong bug report got built.
 *
 * The resolver runs inside the `explore` role, which `role-tools.ts` already
 * gates with `--exclude-tools write,edit,multiedit` (#238). That is not
 * incidental: "Ask or Assume?" (69.4% on an underspecified SWE-bench variant)
 * finds that an agent holding edit tools rationalises ambiguity away, because
 * building is cheaper than asking. The resolver structurally cannot build.
 *
 * Grouping markers, where present, are consumed as high-confidence hints. They
 * are never required — that is the whole point.
