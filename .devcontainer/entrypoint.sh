# pi-rukas container entrypoint.
#
# Runs as root briefly to do one-time fixups that need it (currently just
# relaxing the host docker socket perms when bind-mounted), then drops to
# the vscode user via `setpriv` for the rest of boot + the user's command.
# Self re-entry pattern: root branch exec's setpriv back into this same
# script as vscode, which then skips the root-only block.
#
# Why setpriv vs sudo: Debian's sudo default `secure_path` clobbers PATH,
# stripping /usr/local/cargo/bin (and any other custom PATH the image set
# via ENV). setpriv preserves env verbatim; we re-set HOME explicitly so
# the vscode-phase cache logic writes to /home/vscode/.cache/, not /root/.
#
# Why re-entry vs forking child scripts: keeps all entrypoint logic in one
# file so future maintainers see the boot sequence top-to-bottom without
# chasing through helper scripts.
#
# Cache-seed history: when the wrapper or devcontainer.json mounts a named
# volume on /home/vscode/.cache, that volume MASKS the image's pre-fetched
# HF cache (Docker volume init only fires on first attach — existing volumes
# from prior image builds stay empty). Without this script, vipune would try
# to download BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 on every fresh container start and fail
# with "Failed to download embedding model" (vipune's HTTP client 404s on
# the pinned revision). Seed the cache from /opt/hf-cache-seed/ if missing.

  # exposes. On Docker Desktop / many Linux hosts that's root-owned, which
  # leaves the vscode user (UID 1000) unable to connect. Relaxing to 666 is
  # safe inside the container: the container is a single trust domain anyway
  # (trust mode already strips per-call gating), and on the HOST side the
  # socket's normal perms are unchanged — we only modify the inode view
  # inside our container. Silenced if it fails (read-only mount edge cases).

  #   (a) Socket is a real socket but root-owned with restrictive perms
  #       (Linux hosts where the user's agent socket isn't world-writable).
  #       Same fix as docker.sock: chmod 666. Single-trust-domain container.
  #   (b) Mount destination ended up as a DIRECTORY, not a socket — happens
  #       when Docker can't resolve the host-side path as a usable socket at
  #       mount time. macOS Docker Desktop + launchd-managed agent paths
  #       (`/private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.<random>/Listeners`) are the
  #       canonical case. SSH would loop on "Error connecting to agent"
  #       even though on-disk keys at ~/.ssh/ would work fine. Unset
  #       SSH_AUTH_SOCK so SSH falls back cleanly. The `unset` propagates
  #       through the upcoming `exec env HOME=... setpriv ... "$0" "$@"`

  # When build_mounts() falls back to a named volume (host dir missing) or
  # mounts an always-on cache volume, and the mount point didn't exist in the
  # image at launch time, Docker creates the volume owned by root (755), which
  # the vscode user (UID 1000) can't write to — crashing pi on first launch in
  # a freshly-created sandbox, or breaking shell history in legacy volumes.
  #
  # We chown ONLY targets the launcher explicitly handed us via
  # PI_ENSEMBLE_VOLUME_MOUNTS (the container-side destinations of every named
  # volume it mounted, colon-separated) AND that appear on the hard-coded
  # allowlist below. A bind-mounted host directory is path-/socket-sourced and
  # is never on the list, so it can never be chowned here (a root-owned host
  # binding must stay untouched). Only directories that are actually
  # root-owned are changed; absence or empties mean no-op, so devcontainer.json
  # users (always bind mounts) and a bare `docker run` are unaffected.
