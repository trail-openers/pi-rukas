# Refused: everything else — Git Bash / MSYS2 / Cygwin on native Windows,
# and BSDs or other exotic Unixes. This guard is deliberately NEGATIVE (refuse
# when uname -s is neither Linux nor Darwin) rather than a positive match on
# MSYS*/MINGW*/CYGWIN*: a bash script can only run on Windows under Git Bash,
# MSYS2, Cygwin or WSL, so a positive matchlist catches the closest-to-working
# environments and misses every genuinely broken one. On Linux and macOS
# uname -s is exactly "Linux" or "Darwin" (WSL2 reports "Linux"), so an exact
# match on those two values is safe.
#
# Native PowerShell and cmd never reach this script at all — the shebang
# excludes them — and are addressed by the README's platform statement alone;
# this guard covers the shells that DO execute it but cannot complete.

#
# codebase-memory-mcp ships its own install script that writes MCP configs for

# Pi uses). pi-mcp-adapter reads (precedence-ordered):
#   1. ~/.config/mcp/mcp.json   (user-global, preferred)
#   2. <PI_AGENT_DIR>/mcp.json  (Pi global override)
#   3. .mcp.json                (project-scoped)
#   4. .pi/mcp.json             (Pi project override)
#
# Without an entry in one of these, `/mcp` shows "0/0 servers, 0 tools" and
# every dispatched subagent fails the first codebase_memory_* call. pi-ensemble
# DOES depend on codebase-memory-mcp (see modules/core/codebase-memory-mcp.md)
# so we wire it explicitly into the user-global config — idempotent, merge-
# safe with other MCP servers the user already configured.
#
# Server-key is `codebase_memory` (underscore, not the binary's hyphenated
# package name) so pi-mcp-adapter's formatToolName produces tool names that
# match our doctrine exactly: `codebase_memory_search_code`, `_trace_path`,
# `_detect_changes`, etc. The seven read-side tools are surfaced via
# directTools so per-tool agents.json permissions work. Admin tools
# (index_repository, delete_project, manage_adr, index_status, list_projects,
# ingest_traces) stay behind the proxy `mcp` tool, gated by `"mcp": "ask"|
# "allow"` per role.

# PATH-portability: we write the BINARY NAME (not the resolved absolute
# path) so the same mcp.json works in both host AND sandbox-container
# contexts. Node's child_process.spawn falls back to $PATH for any
# non-absolute first-arg. Host has `~/.local/bin/codebase-memory-mcp` on
# PATH (per upstream installer); container has `/usr/local/bin/
# codebase-memory-mcp` (per .devcontainer/Dockerfile). Same key, different
# binary location, no mcp.json rewrite needed at container entry.
# PR #200 shipped absolute paths and the sandbox couldn't spawn the host
# path; this fix makes mcp.json portable.

# ---- 6b. Pi provider retry defaults (PR #236, retuned by #295, extended by #313) --
#
# Two timeout knobs control provider request lifetimes:
#
# 1. `retry.provider.timeoutMs` — the OUTER per-request SDK deadline. Pi-ai
#    uses this as the overall HTTP request timeout. Without it, providers
#    default to ~10 min before a hung request falls out as a synthetic
#    `stopReason: error` assistant message (see PR #236). The earlier 3-min
#    default (#236) sat BELOW the legitimate turn length of thinking-heavy
#    models (a single xhigh-thinking turn routinely streams 10-17 min): one
#    slow-but-healthy request would burn two stacked retry layers (~10-17 min
#    of silence) and surface as "Request timed out." / "terminated" on a
#    perfectly healthy endpoint — the #295 reliability regression. 10 min
#    (`600000`) matches pi's own upstream default while keeping the block
#    explicit and operator-tunable.
#
# 2. `httpIdleTimeoutMs` — the INNER undici socket bound. Pi sets BOTH
#    `headersTimeout` (time-to-first-byte) AND `bodyTimeout` (time between
#    chunks) to this value. THE SMALLER OF THE TWO KNOBS WINS — raising the
#    outer to 600000 in #295 while leaving the inner at Pi's own default of
#    300000 made the outer largely inert for time-to-first-byte failures; the
#    inner fired first, then retries compounded: 4 x 300s + 3 x 60s = ~23 min
#    of total wall-clock to discover a single failed request.
#
# The trade-off: one key (`httpIdleTimeoutMs`) drives both timeouts, but they
# want opposite values. `headersTimeout` should be seconds (a dead socket
# never sends headers). `bodyTimeout` must tolerate minutes (thinking-heavy
# generation pauses between chunks). **60000 was tried in production and
# demonstrably aborted healthy streams mid-generation at xhigh thinking — two
# dispatches died at ~4m50s. 120000 (2 min) is the tested floor.** Do not
# lower it without re-testing under a thinking-heavy model.
#
# `httpIdleTimeoutMs` was introduced in Pi 0.75.4 (one patch AFTER
# pi-ensemble's `~0.75.3` pin) and made universal for all providers in
# 0.78.1. install.sh omitting it was a consequence of the stale pin, not an
# oversight. No single value is correct for both headersTimeout and
# bodyTimeout — that is an upstream Pi limitation this setting cannot fully
# fix.
#
# `maxRetryDelayMs` restored to Pi's own default of 60000. It had been lowered
# to 10000 on the reasoning that "with 3 retries, the old value added 3 x 60s
# of backoff". That reasoning was wrong: `maxRetryDelayMs` is a CEILING, not
# a delay — Pi's own backoff is `min(0.5 * 2 ** retryIndex, 8) * 1000`,
# capped at 8s, always below the old 10s ceiling — so lowering it changed
# nothing except that a provider's explicit `retry-after` (routinely 59-60s)
# was discarded without waiting at all. One measured run: three parallel
# research children and two /work developers all died on
# `Server requested 59s retry delay (max: 10s). 429 status code` having
# gathered ~305k characters between them; at 60000 the same 429 is slept
# through and the work survives.
#
# Idempotent + non-clobbering: writes the block only when
# `retry.provider.timeoutMs` is absent (or null). Two exceptions, both our own
# footprints rather than operator choices, repaired wherever they are found:
# `timeoutMs` of exactly 180000 (#236), and `maxRetryDelayMs` of exactly 10000
# (the value documented above). Any other value is preserved.

Next steps:
  - **Sandboxed mode (recommended)**: in any git repo, run \`pi-ensemble\`
    to launch Pi inside a Docker container. Zero permission prompts inside.
    Your host \`~/.vipune/\` and \`~/.pi/agent/ensemble-runs/\` are bind-
    mounted in, so memories and transcripts survive across host + container.
  - **Host mode (legacy)**: in any git repo, run \`pi\` directly. Uses the
    layered permission system; expect interactive prompts on novel commands.
  - See \`/ensemble-debug\` (inside Pi) for the live configuration overview.
  - Configure subagent models with \`/ensemble-model\`.
  - Inside a project, run /mcp to confirm codebase_memory is connected (7 direct tools).
  - One-shot index per project on first use:
      mcp({tool: "codebase_memory_index_repository", args: '{"repo_path": "."}'})
    The file watcher keeps it current after that.
